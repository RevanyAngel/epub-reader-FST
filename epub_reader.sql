Stallman literally speaks for itself. From the documented source code to the published papers to the recorded speeches, few people have expressed as much willingness to lay their thoughts and their work on the line. Such openness-if one can pardon a momentary un-Stallman adjective-is refreshing. After all, we live in a society that treats information, especially personal information, as a valuable commodity. The question quickly arises. Why would anybody want to part with so much information and yet appear to demand nothing in return? As we shall see in later chapters, Stallman does not part with his words or his work altruistically. Every program, speech, and on-the-record bon mot comes with a price, albeit not the kind of price most people are used to paying. I bring this up not as a warning, but as an admission. As a person who has spent the last year digging up facts on Stallman\'s personal history, it\'s more than a little intimidating going up against the Stallman oeuvre. \"Never pick a fight with a man who buys his ink by the barrel,\" goes the old Mark Twain adage. In the case of Stallman, never attempt the definitive biography of a man who trusts his every thought to the public record. For the readers who have decided to trust a few hours of their time to exploring this book, I can confidently state that there are facts and quotes in here that one won\'t find in any Slashdot story or Google search. Gaining access to these facts involves paying a price, however. In the case of the book version, you can pay for these facts the traditional manner, i.e., by purchasing the book. In the case of the electronic versions, you can pay for these facts in the free software manner.

And finally, last but not least: thanks to Richard Stallman for having the guts and endurance to \"show us the code.\" Sam Williams For Want of a Printer I fear the Greeks. Even when they bring gifts. —-Virgil The Aeneid The new printer was jammed, again. Richard M. Stallman, a staff software programmer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\'s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab), discovered the malfunction the hard way. An hour after sending off a 50-page file to the office laser printer, Stallman, 27, broke off a productive work session to retrieve his documents. Upon arrival, he found only four pages in the printer\'s tray. To make matters even more frustrating, the four pages belonged to another user, meaning that Stallman\'s print job and the unfinished portion of somebody else\'s print job were still trapped somewhere within the electrical plumbing of the lab\'s computer network. Waiting for machines is an occupational hazard when you\'re a software programmer, so Stallman took his frustration with a grain of salt. Still, the difference between waiting for a machine and waiting on a machine is a sizable one. It wasn\'t the first time he\'d been forced to stand over the printer, watching pages print out one by one. As a person who spent the bulk of his days and nights improving the efficiency of machines and the software programs that controlled them, Stallman felt a natural urge to open up the machine, look at the guts, and seek out the root of the problem. Unfortunately, Stallman\'s skills as a computer programmer did not extend to the mechanical-engineering realm. As freshly printed documents poured out of the machine, Stallman had a chance to reflect on other ways to circumvent the printing jam problem. How long ago had it been that the staff members at the AI Lab had welcomed the new printer with open arms? Stallman wondered. The machine had been a donation from the Xerox Corporation. A cutting edge prototype, it was a modified version of the popular Xerox photocopier. Only instead of making copies, it relied on software data piped in over a computer network to turn that data into professional-looking documents. Created by engineers at the world-famous Xerox Palo Alto Research Facility, it was, quite simply, an early taste of the desktop-printing revolution that would seize the rest of the computing industry by the end of the decade. Driven by an instinctual urge to play with the best new equipment, programmers at the AI Lab promptly integrated the new machine into the lab\'s sophisticated computing infrastructure. The results had been immediately pleasing. Unlike the lab\'s old laser printer, the new Xerox machine was fast. Pages came flying out at a rate of one per second, turning a 20-minute print job into a 2-minute print job. The new machine was also more precise. Circles came out looking like circles, not ovals. Straight lines came out looking like straight lines, not low-amplitude sine waves. It was, for all intents and purposes, a gift too good to refuse. It wasn\'t until a few weeks after its arrival that the machine\'s flaws began to surface. Chief among the drawbacks was the machine\'s inherent susceptibility to paper jams. Engineering-minded programmers quickly understood the reason behind the flaw. As a photocopier, the machine generally required the direct oversight of a human operator. Figuring that these human operators would always be on hand to fix a paper jam, if it occurred, Xerox engineers had devoted their time and energies to eliminating other pesky problems. In engineering terms, user diligence was built into the system. In modifying the machine for printer use, Xerox engineers had changed the user-machine relationship in a subtle but profound way. Instead of making the machine subservient to an individual human operator, they made it subservient to an entire networked population of human operators. Instead of standing directly over the machine, a human user on one end of the network sent his print command through an extended bucket-brigade of machines, expecting the desired content to arrive at the targeted destination and in proper form. It wasn\'t until he finally went to check up on the final output that he realized how little of the desired content had made it through. Stallman himself had been of the first to identify the problem and the first to suggest a remedy. Years before, when the lab was still using its old printer, Stallman had solved a similar problem by opening up the software program that regulated the printer on the lab\'s PDP-11 machine. Stallman couldn\'t eliminate paper jams, but he could insert a software command that ordered the PDP-11 to check the printer periodically and report back to the PDP-10, the lab\'s central computer. To ensure that one user\'s negligence didn\'t bog down an entire line of print jobs, Stallman also inserted a software command that instructed the PDP-10 to notify every user with a waiting print job that the printer was jammed. The notice was simple, something along the lines of \"The printer is jammed, please fix it,\" and because it went out to the people with the most pressing need to fix the problem, chances were higher that the problem got fixed in due time. As fixes go, Stallman\'s was oblique but elegant. It didn\'t fix the mechanical side of the problem, but it did the next best thing by closing the information loop between user and machine. Thanks to a few additional lines of software code, AI Lab employees could eliminate the 10 or 15 minutes wasted each week in running back and forth to check on the printer. In programming terms, Stallman\'s fix took advantage of the amplified intelligence of the overall network. \"If you got that message, you couldn\'t assume somebody else would fix it,\" says Stallman, recalling the logic. \"You had to go to the printer. A minute or two after the printer got in trouble, the two or three people who got messages arrive to fix the machine. Of those two or three people, one of them, at least, would usually know how to fix the problem.\" Such clever fixes were a trademark of the AI Lab and its indigenous population of programmers. Indeed, the best programmers at the AI Lab disdained the term programmer, preferring the more slangy occupational title of hacker instead. The job title covered a host of activities-everything from creative mirth making to the improvement of existing software and computer systems. Implicit within the title, however, was the old-fashioned notion of Yankee ingenuity. To be a hacker, one had to accept the philosophy that writing a software program was only the beginning. Improving a program was the true test of a hacker\'s skills.For more on the term \"hacker,\" see Appendix B. Such a philosophy was a major reason why companies like Xerox made it a policy to donate their machines and software programs to places where hackers typically congregated. If hackers improved the software, companies could borrow back the improvements, incorporating them into update versions for the commercial marketplace. In corporate terms, hackers were a leveragable community asset, an auxiliary research-and-development division available at minimal cost. It was because of this give-and-take philosophy that when Stallman spotted the print-jam defect in the Xerox laser printer, he didn\'t panic. He simply looked for a way to update the old fix or \" hack\" for the new system. In the course of looking up the Xerox laser-printer software, however, Stallman made a troubling discovery. The printer didn\'t have any software, at least nothing Stallman or a fellow programmer could read. Until then, most companies had made it a form of courtesy to publish source-code files-readable text files that documented the individual software commands that told a machine what to do. Xerox, in this instance, had provided software files in precompiled, or binary, form. Programmers were free to open the files up if they wanted to, but unless they were an expert in deciphering an endless stream of ones and zeroes, the resulting text was pure gibberish. Although Stallman knew plenty about computers, he was not an expert in translating binary files. As a hacker, however, he had other resources at his disposal. The notion of information sharing was so central to the hacker culture that Stallman knew it was only a matter of time before some hacker in some university lab or corporate computer room proffered a version of the laser-printer source code with the desired source-code files. After the first few printer jams, Stallman comforted himself with the memory of a similar situation years before. The lab had needed a cross-network program to help the PDP-11 work more efficiently with the PDP-10. The lab\'s hackers were more than up to the task, but Stallman, a Harvard alumnus, recalled a similar program written by programmers at the Harvard computer-science department. The Harvard computer lab used the same model computer, the PDP-10, albeit with a different operating system. The Harvard computer lab also had a policy requiring that all programs installed on the PDP-10 had to come with published source-code files. Taking advantage of his access to the Harvard computer lab, Stallman dropped in, made a copy of the cross-network source code, and brought it back to the AI Lab. He then rewrote the source code to make it more suitable for the AI Lab\'s operating system. With no muss and little fuss, the AI Lab shored up a major gap in its software infrastructure. Stallman even added a few features not found in the original Harvard program, making the program even more useful. \"We wound up using it for several years,\" Stallman says. From the perspective of a 1970s-era programmer, the transaction was the software equivalent of a neighbor stopping by to borrow a power tool or a cup of sugar from a neighbor. The only difference was that in borrowing a copy of the software for the AI Lab, Stallman had done nothing to deprive Harvard hackers the use of their original program. If anything, Harvard hackers gained in the process, because Stallman had introduced his own additional features to the program, features that hackers at Harvard were perfectly free to borrow in return. Although nobody at Harvard ever came over to borrow the program back, Stallman does recall a programmer at the private engineering firm, Bolt, Beranek & Newman, borrowing the program and adding a few additional features, which Stallman eventually reintegrated into the AI Lab\'s own source-code archive. \"A program would develop the way a city develops,\" says Stallman, recalling the software infrastructure of the AI Lab. \"Parts would get replaced and rebuilt. New things would get added on. But you could always look at a certain part and say, `Hmm, by the style, I see this part was written back in the early 60s and this part was written in the mid-1970s.\'\" Through this simple system of intellectual accretion, hackers at the AI Lab and other places built up robust creations. On the west coast, computer scientists at UC Berkeley, working in cooperation with a few low-level engineers at AT&T, had built up an entire operating system using this system. Dubbed Unix, a play on an older, more academically respectable operating system called Multics, the software system was available to any programmer willing to pay for the cost of copying the program onto a new magnetic tape and shipping it. Not every programmer participating in this culture described himself as a hacker, but most shared the sentiments of Richard M. Stallman. If a program or software fix was good enough to solve your problems, it was good enough to solve somebody else\'s problems. Why not share it out of a simple desire for good karma? The fact that Xerox had been unwilling to share its source-code files seemed a minor annoyance at first. In tracking down a copy of the source-code files, Stallman says he didn\'t even bother contacting Xerox. \"They had already given us the laser printer,\" Stallman says. \"Why should I bug them for more?\" When the desired files failed to surface, however, Stallman began to grow suspicious. The year before, Stallman had experienced a blow up with a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University. The student, Brian Reid, was the author of a useful text-formatting program dubbed Scribe. One of the first programs that gave a user the power to define fonts and type styles when sending a document over a computer network, the program was an early harbinger of HTML, the lingua franca of the World Wide Web. In 1979, Reid made the decision to sell Scribe to a Pittsburgh-area software company called Unilogic. His graduate-student career ending, Reid says he simply was looking for a way to unload the program on a set of developers that would take pains to keep it from slipping into the public domain. To sweeten the deal, Reid also agreed to insert a set of time-dependent functions- \"time bombs\" in software-programmer parlance-that deactivated freely copied versions of the program after a 90-day expiration date. To avoid deactivation, users paid the software company, which then issued a code that defused the internal time-bomb feature. For Reid, the deal was a win-win. Scribe didn\'t fall into the public domain, and Unilogic recouped on its investment. For Stallman, it was a betrayal of the programmer ethos, pure and simple. Instead of honoring the notion of share-and-share alike, Reid had inserted a way for companies to compel programmers to pay for information access. As the weeks passed and his attempts to track down Xerox laser-printer source code hit a brick wall, Stallman began to sense a similar money-for-code scenario at work. Before Stallman could do or say anything about it, however, good news finally trickled in via the programmer grapevine. Word had it that a scientist at the computer-science department at Carnegie Mellon University had just departed a job at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. Not only had the scientist worked on the laser printer in question, but according to rumor, he was still working on it as part of his research duties at Carnegie Mellon. Casting aside his initial suspicion, Stallman made a firm resolution to seek out the person in question during his next visit to the Carnegie Mellon campus. He didn\'t have to wait long. Carnegie Mellon also had a lab specializing in artificial-intelligence research, and within a few months, Stallman had a business-related reason to visit the Carnegie Mellon campus. During that visit, he made sure to stop by the computer-science department. Department employees directed him to the office of the faculty member leading the Xerox project. When Stallman reached the office, he found the professor working there. In true engineer-to-engineer fashion, the conversation was cordial but blunt. After briefly introducing himself as a visitor from MIT, Stallman requested a copy of the laser-printer source code so that he could port it to the PDP-11. To his surprise, the professor refused to grant his request. \"He told me that he had promised not to give me a copy,\" Stallman says. Memory is a funny thing. Twenty years after the fact, Stallman\'s mental history tape is notoriously blank in places. Not only does he not remember the motivating reason for the trip or even the time of year during which he took it, he also has no recollection of the professor or doctoral student on the other end of the conversation. According to Reid, the person most likely to have fielded Stallman\'s request is Robert Sproull, a former Xerox PARC researcher and current director of Sun Laboratories, a research division of the computer-technology conglomerate Sun Microsystems. During the 1970s, Sproull had been the primary developer of the laser-printer software in question while at Xerox PARC. Around 1980, Sproull took a faculty research position at Carnegie Mellon where he continued his laser-printer work amid other projects. \"The code that Stallman was asking for was leading-edge state-of-the-art code that Sproull had written in the year or so before going to Carnegie Mellon,\" recalls Reid. \"I suspect that Sproull had been at Carnegie Mellon less than a month before this request came in.\" When asked directly about the request, however, Sproull draws a blank. \"I can\'t make a factual comment,\" writes Sproull via email. \"I have absolutely no recollection of the incident.\" With both participants in the brief conversation struggling to recall key details-including whether the conversation even took place-it\'s hard to gauge the bluntness of Sproull\'s refusal, at least as recalled by Stallman. In talking to audiences, Stallman has made repeated reference to the incident, noting that Sproull\'s unwillingness to hand over the source code stemmed from a nondisclosure agreement, a contractual agreement between Sproull and the Xerox Corporation giving Sproull, or any other signatory, access the software source code in exchange for a promise of secrecy. Now a standard item of business in the software industry, the nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, was a novel development at the time, a reflection of both the commercial value of the laser printer to Xerox and the information needed to run it. \"Xerox was at the time trying to make a commercial product out of the laser printer,\" recalls Reid. \"They would have been insane to give away the source code.\" For Stallman, however, the NDA was something else entirely. It was a refusal on the part of Xerox and Sproull, or whomever the person was that turned down his source-code request that day, to participate in a system that, until then, had encouraged software programmers to regard programs as communal resources. Like a peasant whose centuries-old irrigation ditch had grown suddenly dry, Stallman had followed the ditch to its source only to find a brand-spanking-new hydroelectric dam bearing the Xerox logo. For Stallman, the realization that Xerox had compelled a fellow programmer to participate in this newfangled system of compelled secrecy took a while to sink in. At first, all he could focus on was the personal nature of the refusal. As a person who felt awkward and out of sync in most face-to-face encounters, Stallman\'s attempt to drop in on a fellow programmer unannounced had been intended as a demonstration of neighborliness. Now that the request had been refused, it felt like a major blunder. \"I was so angry I couldn\'t think of a way to express it. So I just turned away and walked out without another word,\" Stallman recalls. \"I might have slammed the door. Who knows? All I remember is wanting to get out of there.\" Twenty years after the fact, the anger still lingers, so much so that Stallman has elevated the event into a major turning point. Within the next few months, a series of events would befall both Stallman and the AI Lab hacker community that would make 30 seconds worth of tension in a remote Carnegie Mellon office seem trivial by comparison. Nevertheless, when it comes time to sort out the events that would transform Stallman from a lone hacker, instinctively suspicious of centralized authority, to a crusading activist applying traditional notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity to the world of software development, Stallman singles out the Carnegie Mellon encounter for special attention. \"It encouraged me to think about something that I\'d already been thinking about,\" says Stallman. \"I already had an idea that software should be shared, but I wasn\'t sure how to think about that. My thoughts weren\'t clear and organized to the point where I could express them in a concise fashion to the rest of the world.\" Although previous events had raised Stallman\'s ire, he says it wasn\'t until his Carnegie Mellon encounter that he realized the events were beginning to intrude on a culture he had long considered sacrosanct. As an elite programmer at one of the world\'s elite institutions, Stallman had been perfectly willing to ignore the compromises and bargains of his fellow programmers just so long as they didn\'t interfere with his own work. Until the arrival of the Xerox laser printer, Stallman had been content to look down on the machines and programs other computer users grimly tolerated. On the rare occasion that such a program breached the AI Lab\'s walls-when the lab replaced its venerable Incompatible Time Sharing operating system with a commercial variant, the TOPS 20, for example-Stallman and his hacker colleagues had been free to rewrite, reshape, and rename the software according to personal taste. Now that the laser printer had insinuated itself within the AI Lab\'s network, however, something had changed. The machine worked fine, barring the occasional paper jam, but the ability to modify according to personal taste had disappeared. From the viewpoint of the entire software industry, the printer was a wake-up call. Software had become such a valuable asset that companies no longer felt the need to publicize source code, especially when publication meant giving potential competitors a chance to duplicate something cheaply. From Stallman\'s viewpoint, the printer was a Trojan Horse. After a decade of failure, privately owned software-future hackers would use the term \" proprietary\" software-had gained a foothold inside the AI Lab through the sneakiest of methods. It had come disguised as a gift. That Xerox had offered some programmers access to additional gifts in exchange for secrecy was also galling, but Stallman takes pains to note that, if presented with such a quid pro quo bargain at a younger age, he just might have taken the Xerox Corporation up on its offer. The awkwardness of the Carnegie Mellon encounter, however, had a firming effect on Stallman\'s own moral lassitude. Not only did it give him the necessary anger to view all future entreaties with suspicion, it also forced him to ask the uncomfortable question: what if a fellow hacker dropped into Stallman\'s office someday and it suddenly became Stallman\'s job to refuse the hacker\'s request for source code? \"It was my first encounter with a nondisclosure agreement, and it immediately taught me that nondisclosure agreements have victims,\" says Stallman, firmly. \"In this case I was the victim. [My lab and I] were victims.\" It was a lesson Stallman would carry with him through the tumultuous years of the 1980s, a decade during which many of his MIT colleagues would depart the AI Lab and sign nondisclosure agreements of their own. Because most nondisclosure aggreements (NDAs) had expiration dates, few hackers who did sign them saw little need for personal introspection. Sooner or later, they reasoned, the software would become public knowledge. In the meantime, promising to keep the software secret during its earliest development stages was all a part of the compromise deal that allowed hackers to work on the best projects. For Stallman, however, it was the first step down a slippery slope. \"When somebody invited me to betray all my colleagues in that way, I remembered how angry I was when somebody else had done that to me and my whole lab,\" Stallman says. \"So I said, `Thank you very much for offering me this nice software package, but I can\'t accept it on the conditions that you\'re asking for, so I\'m going to do without it.\'\" As Stallman would quickly learn, refusing such requests involved more than personal sacrifice. It involved segregating himself from fellow hackers who, though sharing a similar distaste for secrecy, tended to express that distaste in a more morally flexible fashion. It wasn\'t long before Stallman, increasingly an outcast even within the AI Lab, began billing himself as \"the last true hacker,\" isolating himself further and further from a marketplace dominated by proprietary software. Refusing another\'s request for source code, Stallman decided, was not only a betrayal of the scientific mission that had nurtured software development since the end of World War II, it was a violation of the Golden Rule, the baseline moral dictate to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Hence the importance of the laser printer and the encounter that resulted from it. Without it, Stallman says, his life might have followed a more ordinary path, one balancing the riches of a commercial programmer with the ultimate frustration of a life spent writing invisible software code. There would have been no sense of clarity, no urgency to address a problem others weren\'t addressing. Most importantly, there would have been no righteous anger, an emotion that, as we soon shall see, has propelled Stallman\'s career as surely as any political ideology or ethical belief. \"From that day forward, I decided this was something I could never participate in,\" says Stallman, alluding to the practice of trading personal liberty for the sake of convenience-Stallman\'s description of the NDA bargain-as well as the overall culture that encouraged such ethically suspect deal-making in the first place. \"I decided never to make other people victims just like I had been a victim.\" 2001: A Hacker\'s Odyssey The New York University computer-science department sits inside Warren Weaver Hall, a fortress-like building located two blocks east of Washington Square Park. Industrial-strength air-conditioning vents create a surrounding moat of hot air, discouraging loiterers and solicitors alike. Visitors who breach the moat encounter another formidable barrier, a security check-in counter immediately inside the building\'s single entryway. Beyond the security checkpoint, the atmosphere relaxes somewhat. Still, numerous signs scattered throughout the first floor preach the dangers of unsecured doors and propped-open fire exits. Taken as a whole, the signs offer a reminder: even in the relatively tranquil confines of pre-September 11, 2001, New York, one can never be too careful or too suspicious. The signs offer an interesting thematic counterpoint to the growing number of visitors gathering in the hall\'s interior atrium. A few look like NYU students. Most look like shaggy-aired concert-goers milling outside a music hall in anticipation of the main act. For one brief morning, the masses have taken over Warren Weaver Hall, leaving the nearby security attendant with nothing better to do but watch Ricki Lake on TV and shrug her shoulders toward the nearby auditorium whenever visitors ask about \"the speech.\" Once inside the auditorium, a visitor finds the person who has forced this temporary shutdown of building security procedures. The person is Richard M. Stallman, founder of the GNU Project, original president of the Free Software Foundation, winner of the 1990 MacArthur Fellowship, winner of the Association of Computing Machinery\'s Grace Murray Hopper Award (also in 1990), corecipient of the Takeda Foundation\'s 2001 Takeda Award, and former AI Lab hacker. As announced over a host of hacker-related web sites, including the GNU Project\'s own http://www.gnu.org site, Stallman is in Manhattan, his former hometown, to deliver a much anticipated speech in rebuttal to the Microsoft Corporation\'s recent campaign against the GNU General Public License. The subject of Stallman\'s speech is the history and future of the free software movement. The location is significant. Less than a month before, Microsoft senior vice president Craig Mundie appeared at the nearby NYU Stern School of Business, delivering a speech blasting the General Public License, or GPL, a legal device originally conceived by Stallman 16 years before. Built to counteract the growing wave of software secrecy overtaking the computer industry-a wave first noticed by Stallman during his 1980 troubles with the Xerox laser printer-the GPL has evolved into a central tool of the free software community. In simplest terms, the GPL locks software programs into a form of communal ownership-what today\'s legal scholars now call the \"digital commons\"-through the legal weight of copyright. Once locked, programs remain unremovable. Derivative versions must carry the same copyright protection-even derivative versions that bear only a small snippet of the original source code. For this reason, some within the software industry have taken to calling the GPL a \"viral\" license, because it spreads itself to every software program it touches. Actually, the GPL\'s powers are not quite that potent. According to section 10 of the GNU General Public License, Version 2 (1991), the viral nature of the license depends heavily on the Free Software Foundation\'s willingness to view a program as a derivative work, not to mention the existing license the GPL would replace. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software that is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \"To compare something to a virus is very harsh,\" says Stallman. \"A spider plant is a more accurate comparison; it goes to another place if you actively take a cutting.\" For more information on the GNU General Public License, visit [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.] In an information economy increasingly dependent on software and increasingly beholden to software standards, the GPL has become the proverbial \"big stick.\" Even companies that once laughed it off as software socialism have come around to recognize the benefits. Linux, the Unix-like kernel developed by Finnish college student Linus Torvalds in 1991, is licensed under the GPL, as are many of the world\'s most popular programming tools: GNU Emacs, the GNU Debugger, the GNU C Compiler, etc. Together, these tools form the components of a free software operating system developed, nurtured, and owned by the worldwide hacker community. Instead of viewing this community as a threat, high-tech companies like IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Sun Microsystems have come to rely upon it, selling software applications and services built to ride atop the ever-growing free software infrastructure. They\'ve also come to rely upon it as a strategic weapon in the hacker community\'s perennial war against Microsoft, the Redmond, Washington-based company that, for better or worse, has dominated the PC-software marketplace since the late 1980s. As owner of the popular Windows operating system, Microsoft stands to lose the most in an industry-wide shift to the GPL license. Almost every line of source code in the Windows colossus is protected by copyrights reaffirming the private nature of the underlying source code or, at the very least, reaffirming Microsoft\'s legal ability to treat it as such. From the Microsoft viewpoint, incorporating programs protected by the \"viral\" GPL into the Windows colossus would be the software equivalent of Superman downing a bottle of Kryptonite pills. Rival companies could suddenly copy, modify, and sell improved versions of Windows, rendering the company\'s indomitable position as the No. 1 provider of consumer-oriented software instantly vulnerable. Hence the company\'s growing concern over the GPL\'s rate of adoption. Hence the recent Mundie speech blasting the GPL and the \" open source\" approach to software development and sales. And hence Stallman\'s decision to deliver a public rebuttal to that speech on the same campus here today. 20 years is a long time in the software industry. Consider this: in 1980, when Richard Stallman was cursing the AI Lab\'s Xerox laser printer, Microsoft, the company modern hackers view as the most powerful force in the worldwide software industry, was still a privately held startup. IBM, the company hackers used to regard as the most powerful force in the worldwide software industry, had yet to to introduce its first personal computer, thereby igniting the current low-cost PC market. Many of the technologies we now take for granted-the World Wide Web, satellite television, 32-bit video-game consoles-didn\'t even exist. The same goes for many of the companies that now fill the upper echelons of the corporate establishment, companies like AOL, Sun Microsystems, Amazon.com, Compaq, and Dell. The list goes on and on. The fact that the high-technology marketplace has come so far in such little time is fuel for both sides of the GPL debate. GPL-proponents point to the short lifespan of most computer hardware platforms. Facing the risk of buying an obsolete product, consumers tend to flock to companies with the best long-term survival. As a result, the software marketplace has become a winner-take-all arena.See Shubha Ghosh, \"Revealing the Microsoft Windows Source Code,\" Gigalaw.com (January, 2000). http://www.gigalaw.com/articles/ghosh-2000-01-p1.html The current, privately owned software environment, GPL-proponents say, leads to monopoly abuse and stagnation. Strong companies suck all the oxygen out of the marketplace for rival competitors and innovative startups. GPL-opponents argue just the opposite. Selling software is just as risky, if not more risky, than buying software, they say. Without the legal guarantees provided by private software licenses, not to mention the economic prospects of a privately owned \"killer app\" (i.e., a breakthrough technology that launches an entirely new market),Killer apps don\'t have to be proprietary. Witness, of course, the legendary Mosaic browser, a program whose copyright permits noncommercial derivatives with certain restrictions. Still, I think the reader gets the point: the software marketplace is like the lottery. The bigger the potential payoff, the more people want to participate. For a good summary of the killer-app phenomenon, see Philip Ben-David, \"Whatever Happened to the `Killer App\'?\" e-Commerce News (December 7, 2000). companies lose the incentive to participate. Once again, the market stagnates and innovation declines. As Mundie himself noted in his May 3 address on the same campus, the GPL\'s \"viral\" nature \"poses a threat\" to any company that relies on the uniqueness of its software as a competitive asset. Added Mundie: It also fundamentally undermines the independent commercial software sector because it effectively makes it impossible to distribute software on a basis where recipients pay for the product rather than just the cost of distributionSee Craig Mundie, \"The Commercial Software Model,\" senior vice president, Microsoft Corp. Excerpted from an online transcript of Mundie\'s May 3,speech to the New York University Stern School of Business. http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/story/5893.html 001, http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/craig/05-03sharedsource.asp  The mutual success of GNU/ LinuxThe acronym GNU stands for \"GNU\'s not Unix.\" In another portion of the May 29, 2001, NYU speech, Stallman summed up the acronym\'s origin: We hackers always look for a funny or naughty name for a program, because naming a program is half the fun of writing the program. We also had a tradition of recursive acronyms, to say that the program that you\'re writing is similar to some existing program . . . I looked for a recursive acronym for Something Is Not UNIX. And I tried all 26 letters and discovered that none of them was a word. I decided to make it a contraction. That way I could have a three-letter acronym, for Something\'s Not UNIX. And I tried letters, and I came across the word \"GNU.\" That was it. Although a fan of puns, Stallman recommends that software users pronounce the \"g\" at the beginning of the acronym (i.e., \"gah-new\"). Not only does this avoid confusion with the word \"gnu,\" the name of the African antelope, Connochaetes gnou , it also avoids confusion with the adjective \"new.\" \"We\'ve been working on it for 17 years now, so it is not exactly new any more,\" Stallman says. Source: author notes and online transcript of \"Free Software: Freedom and Cooperation,\" Richard Stallman\'s May 29, 2001, speech at New York University. http://www.gnu.org/events/rms-nyu-2001-transcript.txt , the amalgamated operating system built around the GPL-protected Linux kernel, and Windows over the last 10 years reveals the wisdom of both perspectives. Nevertheless, the battle for momentum is an important one in the software industry. Even powerful vendors such as Microsoft rely on the support of third-party software developers whose tools, programs, and computer games make an underlying software platform such as Windows more attractive to the mainstream consumer. Citing the rapid evolution of the technology marketplace over the last 20 years, not to mention his own company\'s admirable track record during that period, Mundie advised listeners to not get too carried away by the free software movement\'s recent momentum: Two decades of experience have shown that an economic model that protects intellectual property and a business model that recoups research and development costs can create impressive economic benefits and distribute them very broadly. Such admonitions serve as the backdrop for Stallman\'s speech today. Less than a month after their utterance, Stallman stands with his back to one of the chalk boards at the front of the room, edgy to begin. If the last two decades have brought dramatic changes to the software marketplace, they have brought even more dramatic changes to Stallman himself. Gone is the skinny, clean-shaven hacker who once spent his entire days communing with his beloved PDP-10. In his place stands a heavy-set middle-aged man with long hair and rabbinical beard, a man who now spends the bulk of his time writing and answering email, haranguing fellow programmers, and giving speeches like the one today. Dressed in an aqua-colored T-shirt and brown polyester pants, Stallman looks like a desert hermit who just stepped out of a Salvation Army dressing room. The crowd is filled with visitors who share Stallman\'s fashion and grooming tastes. Many come bearing laptop computers and cellular modems, all the better to record and transmit Stallman\'s words to a waiting Internet audience. The gender ratio is roughly 15 males to 1 female, and 1 of the 7 or 8 females in the room comes in bearing a stuffed penguin, the official Linux mascot, while another carries a stuffed teddy bear. <Graphic file:/home/craigm/books/free_0201.png> Richard Stallman, circa 2000. \"I decided I would develop a free software operating system or die trying . . of old age of course.\" Photo courtesy of http://www.stallman.org. Agitated, Stallman leaves his post at the front of the room and takes a seat in a front-row chair, tapping a few commands into an already-opened laptop. For the next 10 minutes Stallman is oblivious to the growing number of students, professors, and fans circulating in front of him at the foot of the auditorium stage. Before the speech can begin, the baroque rituals of academic formality must be observed. Stallman\'s appearance merits not one but two introductions. Mike Uretsky, codirector of the Stern School\'s Center for Advanced Technology, provides the first. \"The role of a university is to foster debate and to have interesting discussions,\" Uretsky says. \"This particular presentation, this seminar falls right into that mold. I find the discussion of open source particularly interesting.\" Before Uretsky can get another sentence out, Stallman is on his feet waving him down like a stranded motorist. \"I do free software,\" Stallman says to rising laughter. \"Open source is a different movement.\" The laughter gives way to applause. The room is stocked with Stallman partisans, people who know of his reputation for verbal exactitude, not to mention his much publicized 1998 falling out with the open source software proponents. Most have come to anticipate such outbursts the same way radio fans once waited for Jack Benny\'s trademark, \"Now cut that out!\" phrase during each radio program. Uretsky hastily finishes his introduction and cedes the stage to Edmond Schonberg, a professor in the NYU computer-science department. As a computer programmer and GNU Project contributor, Schonberg knows which linguistic land mines to avoid. He deftly summarizes Stallman\'s career from the perspective of a modern-day programmer. \"Richard is the perfect example of somebody who, by acting locally, started thinking globally [about] problems concerning the unavailability of source code,\" says Schonberg. \"He has developed a coherent philosophy that has forced all of us to reexamine our ideas of how software is produced, of what intellectual property means, and of what the software community actually represents.\" Schonberg welcomes Stallman to more applause. Stallman takes a moment to shut off his laptop, rises out of his chair, and takes the stage. At first, Stallman\'s address seems more Catskills comedy routine than political speech. \"I\'d like to thank Microsoft for providing me the opportunity to be on this platform,\" Stallman wisecracks. \"For the past few weeks, I have felt like an author whose book was fortuitously banned somewhere.\" For the uninitiated, Stallman dives into a quick free software warm-up analogy. He likens a software program to a cooking recipe. Both provide useful step-by-step instructions on how to complete a desired task and can be easily modified if a user has special desires or circumstances. \"You don\'t have to follow a recipe exactly,\" Stallman notes. \"You can leave out some ingredients. Add some mushrooms, \'cause you like mushrooms. Put in less salt because your doctor said you should cut down on salt-whatever.\" Most importantly, Stallman says, software programs and recipes are both easy to share. In giving a recipe to a dinner guest, a cook loses little more than time and the cost of the paper the recipe was written on. Software programs require even less, usually a few mouse-clicks and a modicum of electricity. In both instances, however, the person giving the information gains two things: increased friendship and the ability to borrow interesting recipes in return. \"Imagine what it would be like if recipes were packaged inside black boxes,\" Stallman says, shifting gears. \"You couldn\'t see what ingredients they\'re using, let alone change them, and imagine if you made a copy for a friend. They would call you a pirate and try to put you in prison for years. That world would create tremendous outrage from all the people who are used to sharing recipes. But that is exactly what the world of proprietary software is like. A world in which common decency towards other people is prohibited or prevented.\" With this introductory analogy out of the way, Stallman launches into a retelling of the Xerox laser-printer episode. Like the recipe analogy, the laser-printer story is a useful rhetorical device. With its parable-like structure, it dramatizes just how quickly things can change in the software world. Drawing listeners back to an era before Amazon.com one-click shopping, Microsoft Windows, and Oracle databases, it asks the listener to examine the notion of software ownership free of its current corporate logos. Stallman delivers the story with all the polish and practice of a local district attorney conducting a closing argument. When he gets to the part about the Carnegie Mellon professor refusing to lend him a copy of the printer source code, Stallman pauses. \"He had betrayed us,\" Stallman says. \"But he didn\'t just do it to us. Chances are he did it to you.\" On the word \"you,\" Stallman points his index finger accusingly at an unsuspecting member of the audience. The targeted audience member\'s eyebrows flinch slightly, but Stallman\'s own eyes have moved on. Slowly and deliberately, Stallman picks out a second listener to nervous titters from the crowd. \"And I think, mostly likely, he did it to you, too,\" he says, pointing at an audience member three rows behind the first. By the time Stallman has a third audience member picked out, the titters have given away to general laughter. The gesture seems a bit staged, because it is. Still, when it comes time to wrap up the Xerox laser-printer story, Stallman does so with a showman\'s flourish. \"He probably did it to most of the people here in this room-except a few, maybe, who weren\'t born yet in 1980,\" Stallman says, drawing more laughs. \"[That\'s] because he had promised to refuse to cooperate with just about the entire population of the planet Earth.\" Stallman lets the comment sink in for a half-beat. \"He had signed a nondisclosure agreement,\" Stallman adds. Richard Matthew Stallman\'s rise from frustrated academic to political leader over the last 20 years speaks to many things. It speaks to Stallman\'s stubborn nature and prodigious will. It speaks to the clearly articulated vision and values of the free software movement Stallman helped build. It speaks to the high-quality software programs Stallman has built, programs that have cemented Stallman\'s reputation as a programming legend. It speaks to the growing momentum of the GPL, a legal innovation that many Stallman observers see as his most momentous accomplishment. Most importantly, it speaks to the changing nature of political power in a world increasingly beholden to computer technology and the software programs that power that technology. Maybe that\'s why, even at a time when most high-technology stars are on the wane, Stallman\'s star has grown. Since launching the GNU Project in 1984,5 Stallman has been at turns ignored, satirized, vilified, and attacked-both from within and without the free software movement. Through it all, the GNU Project has managed to meet its milestones, albeit with a few notorious delays, and stay relevant in a software marketplace several orders of magnitude more complex than the one it entered 18 years ago. So too has the free software ideology, an ideology meticulously groomed by Stallman himself. To understand the reasons behind this currency, it helps to examine Richard Stallman both in his own words and in the words of the people who have collaborated and battled with him along the way. The Richard Stallman character sketch is not a complicated one. If any person exemplifies the old adage \"what you see is what you get,\" it\'s Stallman. \"I think if you want to understand Richard Stallman the human being, you really need to see all of the parts as a consistent whole,\" advises Eben Moglen, legal counsel to the Free Software Foundation and professor of law at Columbia University Law School. \"All those personal eccentricities that lots of people see as obstacles to getting to know Stallman really are Stallman: Richard\'s strong sense of personal frustration, his enormous sense of principled ethical commitment, his inability to compromise, especially on issues he considers fundamental. These are all the very reasons Richard did what he did when he did.\" Explaining how a journey that started with a laser printer would eventually lead to a sparring match with the world\'s richest corporation is no easy task. It requires a thoughtful examination of the forces that have made software ownership so important in today\'s society. It also requires a thoughtful examination of a man who, like many political leaders before him, understands the malleability of human memory. It requires an ability to interpret the myths and politically laden code words that have built up around Stallman over time. Finally, it requires an understanding of Stallman\'s genius as a programmer and his failures and successes in translating that genius to other pursuits. When it comes to offering his own summary of the journey, Stallman acknowledges the fusion of personality and principle observed by Moglen. \"Stubbornness is my strong suit,\" he says. \"Most people who attempt to do anything of any great difficulty eventually get discouraged and give up. I never gave up.\" He also credits blind chance. Had it not been for that run-in over the Xerox laser printer, had it not been for the personal and political conflicts that closed out his career as an MIT employee, had it not been for a half dozen other timely factors, Stallman finds it very easy to picture his life following a different career path. That being said, Stallman gives thanks to the forces and circumstances that put him in the position to make a difference. \"I had just the right skills,\" says Stallman, summing up his decision for launching the GNU Project to the audience. \"Nobody was there but me, so I felt like, `I\'m elected. I have to work on this. If not me , who?\'\" Endnotes 1. Actually, the GPL\'s powers are not quite that potent.

The year was 1961, and Lippman, a recently divorced single mother, was wiling away a weekend afternoon within the family\'s tiny one-bedroom apartment on Manhattan\'s Upper West Side. Leafing through a copy of Scientific American, Lippman came upon her favorite section, the Martin Gardner-authored column titled \"Mathematical Games.\" A substitute art teacher, Lippman always enjoyed Gardner\'s column for the brain-teasers it provided. With her son already ensconced in a book on the nearby sofa, Lippman decided to take a crack at solving the week\'s feature puzzle. \"I wasn\'t the best person when it came to solving the puzzles,\" she admits. \"But as an artist, I found they really helped me work through conceptual barriers.\" Lippman says her attempt to solve the puzzle met an immediate brick wall. About to throw the magazine down in disgust, Lippman was surprised by a gentle tug on her shirt sleeve. \"It was Richard,\" she recalls, \"He wanted to know if I needed any help.\" Looking back and forth, between the puzzle and her son, Lippman says she initially regarded the offer with skepticism. \"I asked Richard if he\'d read the magazine,\" she says. \"He told me that, yes, he had and what\'s more he\'d already solved the puzzle. The next thing I know, he starts explaining to me how to solve it.\" Hearing the logic of her son\'s approach, Lippman\'s skepticism quickly gave way to incredulity. \"I mean, I always knew he was a bright boy,\" she says, \"but this was the first time I\'d seen anything that suggested how advanced he really was.\" Thirty years after the fact, Lippman punctuates the memory with a laugh. \"To tell you the truth, I don\'t think I ever figured out how to solve that puzzle,\" she says. \"All I remember is being amazed he knew the answer.\" Seated at the dining-room table of her second Manhattan apartment-the same spacious three-bedroom complex she and her son moved to following her 1967 marriage to Maurice Lippman, now deceased-Alice Lippman exudes a Jewish mother\'s mixture of pride and bemusement when recalling her son\'s early years. The nearby dining-room credenza offers an eight-by-ten photo of Stallman glowering in full beard and doctoral robes. The image dwarfs accompanying photos of Lippman\'s nieces and nephews, but before a visitor can make too much of it, Lippman makes sure to balance its prominent placement with an ironic wisecrack. \"Richard insisted I have it after he received his honorary doctorate at the University of Glasgow,\" says Lippman. \"He said to me, `Guess what, mom? It\'s the first graduation I ever attended.\'\"1 Such comments reflect the sense of humor that comes with raising a child prodigy. Make no mistake, for every story Lippman hears and reads about her son\'s stubbornness and unusual behavior, she can deliver at least a dozen in return. \"He used to be so conservative,\" she says, throwing up her hands in mock exasperation. \"We used to have the worst arguments right here at this table. I was part of the first group of public city school teachers that struck to form a union, and Richard was very angry with me. He saw unions as corrupt. He was also very opposed to social security. He thought people could make much more money investing it on their own. Who knew that within 10 years he would become so idealistic? All I remember is his stepsister coming to me and saying, `What is he going to be when he grows up? A fascist?\'\" As a single parent for nearly a decade-she and Richard\'s father, Daniel Stallman, were married in 1948, divorced in 1958, and split custody of their son afterwards-Lippman can attest to her son\'s aversion to authority. She can also attest to her son\'s lust for knowledge. It was during the times when the two forces intertwined, Lippman says, that she and her son experienced their biggest battles. \"It was like he never wanted to eat,\" says Lippman, recalling the behavior pattern that set in around age eight and didn\'t let up until her son\'s high-school graduation in 1970. \"I\'d call him for dinner, and he\'d never hear me. I\'d have to call him 9 or 10 times just to get his attention. He was totally immersed.\" Stallman, for his part, remembers things in a similar fashion, albeit with a political twist. \"I enjoyed reading,\" he says. \"If I wanted to read, and my mother told me to go to the kitchen and eat or go to sleep, I wasn\'t going to listen. I saw no reason why I couldn\'t read. No reason why she should be able to tell me what to do, period. Essentially, what I had read about, ideas such as democracy and individual freedom, I applied to myself. I didn\'t see any reason to exclude children from these principles.\" The belief in individual freedom over arbitrary authority extended to school as well. Two years ahead of his classmates by age 11, Stallman endured all the usual frustrations of a gifted public-school student. It wasn\'t long after the puzzle incident that his mother attended the first in what would become a long string of parent-teacher conferences. \"He absolutely refused to write papers,\" says Lippman, recalling an early controversy. \"I think the last paper he wrote before his senior year in high school was an essay on the history of the number system in the west for a fourth-grade teacher.\" Gifted in anything that required analytical thinking, Stallman gravitated toward math and science at the expense of his other studies. What some teachers saw as single-mindedness, however, Lippman saw as impatience. Math and science offered simply too much opportunity to learn, especially in comparison to subjects and pursuits for which her son seemed less naturally inclined. Around age 10 or 11, when the boys in Stallman\'s class began playing a regular game of touch football, she remembers her son coming home in a rage. \"He wanted to play so badly, but he just didn\'t have the coordination skills,\" Lippman recalls. \"It made him so angry.\" The anger eventually drove her son to focus on math and science all the more. Even in the realm of science, however, her son\'s impatience could be problematic. Poring through calculus textbooks by age seven, Stallman saw little need to dumb down his discourse for adults. Sometime, during his middle-school years, Lippman hired a student from nearby Columbia University to play big brother to her son. The student left the family\'s apartment after the first session and never came back. \"I think what Richard was talking about went over his head,\" Lippman speculates. Another favorite maternal anecdote dates back to the early 1960s, shortly after the puzzle incident. Around age seven, two years after the divorce and relocation from Queens, Richard took up the hobby of launching model rockets in nearby Riverside Drive Park. What started as aimless fun soon took on an earnest edge as her son began recording the data from each launch. Like the interest in mathematical games, the pursuit drew little attention until one day, just before a major NASA launch, Lippman checked in on her son to see if he wanted to watch. \"He was fuming,\" Lippman says. \"All he could say to me was, `But I\'m not published yet.\' Apparently he had something that he really wanted to show NASA.\" Such anecdotes offer early evidence of the intensity that would become Stallman\'s chief trademark throughout life. When other kids came to the table, Stallman stayed in his room and read. When other kids played Johnny Unitas, Stallman played Werner von Braun. \"I was weird,\" Stallman says, summing up his early years succinctly in a 1999 interview. \"After a certain age, the only friends I had were teachers.\"See Michael Gross, \"Richard Stallman: High School Misfit, Symbol of Free Software, MacArthur-certified Genius\" (1999). This interview is one of the most candid Stallman interviews on the record. I recommend it highly. http://www.mgross.com/interviews/stallman1.html Although it meant courting more run-ins at school, Lippman decided to indulge her son\'s passion. By age 12, Richard was attending science camps during the summer and private school during the school year. When a teacher recommended her son enroll in the Columbia Science Honors Program, a post-Sputnik program designed for gifted middle- and high-school students in New York City, Stallman added to his extracurriculars and was soon commuting uptown to the Columbia University campus on Saturdays. Dan Chess, a fellow classmate in the Columbia Science Honors Program, recalls Richard Stallman seeming a bit weird even among the students who shared a similar lust for math and science. \"We were all geeks and nerds, but he was unusually poorly adjusted,\" recalls Chess, now a mathematics professor at Hunter College. \"He was also smart as shit. I\'ve known a lot of smart people, but I think he was the smartest person I\'ve ever known.\" Seth Breidbart, a fellow Columbia Science Honors Program alumnus, offers bolstering testimony. A computer programmer who has kept in touch with Stallman thanks to a shared passion for science fiction and science-fiction conventions, he recalls the 15-year-old, buzz-cut-wearing Stallman as \"scary,\" especially to a fellow 15-year-old. \"It\'s hard to describe,\" Breidbart says. \"It wasn\'t like he was unapproachable. He was just very intense. [He was] very knowledgeable but also very hardheaded in some ways.\" Such descriptions give rise to speculation: are judgment-laden adjectives like \"intense\" and \"hardheaded\" simply a way to describe traits that today might be categorized under juvenile behavioral disorder? A December, 2001, Wired magazine article titled \"The Geek Syndrome\" paints the portrait of several scientifically gifted children diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome. In many ways, the parental recollections recorded in the Wired article are eerily similar to the ones offered by Lippman. Even Stallman has indulged in psychiatric revisionism from time to time. During a 2000 profile for the Toronto Star, Stallman described himself to an interviewer as \"borderline autistic,\"See Judy Steed, Toronto Star, BUSINESS, (October 9, 2000): C03. His vision of free software and social cooperation stands in stark contrast to the isolated nature of his private life. A Glenn Gould-like eccentric, the Canadian pianist was similarly brilliant, articulate, and lonely. Stallman considers himself afflicted, to some degree, by autism: a condition that, he says, makes it difficult for him to interact with people. a description that goes a long way toward explaining a lifelong tendency toward social and emotional isolation and the equally lifelong effort to overcome it. Such speculation benefits from the fast and loose nature of most so-called \" behavioral disorders\" nowadays, of course. As Steve Silberman, author of \" The Geek Syndrome,\" notes, American psychiatrists have only recently come to accept Asperger Syndrome as a valid umbrella term covering a wide set of behavioral traits. The traits range from poor motor skills and poor socialization to high intelligence and an almost obsessive affinity for numbers, computers, and ordered systems.See Steve Silberman, \"The Geek Syndrome,\" Wired (December, 2001). Reflecting on the broad nature of this umbrella, Stallman says its possible that, if born 40 years later, he might have merited just such a diagnosis. Then again, so would many of his computer-world colleagues. \"It\'s possible I could have had something like that,\" he says. \"On the other hand, one of the aspects of that syndrome is difficulty following rhythms. I can dance. In fact, I love following the most complicated rhythms. It\'s not clear cut enough to know.\" Chess, for one, rejects such attempts at back-diagnosis. \"I never thought of him [as] having that sort of thing,\" he says. \"He was just very unsocialized, but then, we all were.\" Lippman, on the other hand, entertains the possibility. She recalls a few stories from her son\'s infancy, however, that provide fodder for speculation. A prominent symptom of autism is an oversensitivity to noises and colors, and Lippman recalls two anecdotes that stand out in this regard. \"When Richard was an infant, we\'d take him to the beach,\" she says. \"He would start screaming two or three blocks before we reached the surf. It wasn\'t until the third time that we figured out what was going on: the sound of the surf was hurting his ears.\" She also recalls a similar screaming reaction in relation to color: \"My mother had bright red hair, and every time she\'d stoop down to pick him up, he\'d let out a wail.\" In recent years, Lippman says she has taken to reading books about autism and believes that such episodes were more than coincidental. \"I do feel that Richard had some of the qualities of an autistic child,\" she says. \"I regret that so little was known about autism back then.\" Over time, however, Lippman says her son learned to adjust. By age seven, she says, her son had become fond of standing at the front window of subway trains, mapping out and memorizing the labyrinthian system of railroad tracks underneath the city. It was a hobby that relied on an ability to accommodate the loud noises that accompanied each train ride. \"Only the initial noise seemed to bother him,\" says Lippman. \"It was as if he got shocked by the sound but his nerves learned how to make the adjustment.\" For the most part, Lippman recalls her son exhibiting the excitement, energy, and social skills of any normal boy. It wasn\'t until after a series of traumatic events battered the Stallman household, she says, that her son became introverted and emotionally distant. The first traumatic event was the divorce of Alice and Daniel Stallman, Richard\'s father. Although Lippman says both she and her ex-husband tried to prepare their son for the blow, she says the blow was devastating nonetheless. \"He sort of didn\'t pay attention when we first told him what was happening,\" Lippman recalls. \"But the reality smacked him in the face when he and I moved into a new apartment. The first thing he said was, `Where\'s Dad\'s furniture?\'\" For the next decade, Stallman would spend his weekdays at his mother\'s apartment in Manhattan and his weekends at his father\'s home in Queens. The shuttling back and forth gave him a chance to study a pair of contrasting parenting styles that, to this day, leaves Stallman firmly opposed to the idea of raising children himself. Speaking about his father, a World War II vet who passed away in early 2001, Stallman balances respect with anger. On one hand, there is the man whose moral commitment led him to learn French just so he could be more helpful to Allies when they\'d finally come. On the other hand, there was the parent who always knew how to craft a put-down for cruel effect.Regrettably, I did not get a chance to interview Daniel Stallman for this book. During the early research for this book, Stallman informed me that his father suffered from Alzheimer\'s. When I resumed research in late 2001, I learned, sadly, that Daniel Stallman had died earlier in the year. ');

Then, around age 10 his grandparents passed away in short succession. For Stallman, the loss was devastating. \"I used to go and visit and feel I was in a loving, gentle environment,\" Stallman recalls. \"It was the only place I ever found one, until I went away to college.\" Lippman lists the death of Richard\'s paternal grandparents as the second traumatic event. \"It really upset him,\" she says. He was very close to both his grandparents. Before they died, he was very outgoing, almost a leader-of-the-pack type with the other kids. After they died, he became much more emotionally withdrawn.\" From Stallman\'s perspective, the emotional withdrawal was merely an attempt to deal with the agony of adolescence. Labeling his teenage years a \"pure horror,\" Stallman says he often felt like a deaf person amid a crowd of chattering music listeners. \"I often had the feeling that I couldn\'t understand what other people were saying,\" says Stallman, recalling the emotional bubble that insulated him from the rest of the adolescent and adult world. \"I could understand the words, but something was going on underneath the conversations that I didn\'t understand. I couldn\'t understand why people were interested in the things other people said.\" For all the agony it produced, adolescence would have a encouraging effect on Stallman\'s sense of individuality. At a time when most of his classmates were growing their hair out, Stallman preferred to keep his short. At a time when the whole teenage world was listening to rock and roll, Stallman preferred classical music. A devoted fan of science fiction, Mad magazine, and late-night TV, Stallman cultivated a distinctly off-the-wall personality that fed off the incomprehension of parents and peers alike. \"Oh, the puns,\" says Lippman, still exasperated by the memory of her son\'s teenage personality. \"There wasn\'t a thing you could say at the dinner table that he couldn\'t throw back at you as a pun.\" Outside the home, Stallman saved the jokes for the adults who tended to indulge his gifted nature. One of the first was a summer-camp counselor who handed Stallman a print-out manual for the IBM 7094 computer during his 12th year. To a preteenager fascinated with numbers and science, the gift was a godsend.Stallman, an atheist, would probably quibble with this description. Suffice it to say, it was something Stallman welcomed. See previous note 1: \"As soon as I heard about computers, I wanted to see one and play with one.\" By the end of summer, Stallman was writing out paper programs according to the 7094\'s internal specifications, anxiously anticipating getting a chance to try them out on a real machine. With the first personal computer still a decade away, Stallman would be forced to wait a few years before getting access to his first computer. His first chance finally came during his junior year of high school. Hired on at the IBM New York Scientific Center, a now-defunct research facility in downtown Manhattan, Stallman spent the summer after high-school graduation writing his first program, a pre-processor for the 7094 written in the programming language PL/I. \"I first wrote it in PL/I, then started over in assembler language when the PL/I program was too big to fit in the computer,\" he recalls. After that job at the IBM Scientific Center, Stallman had held a laboratory-assistant position in the biology department at Rockefeller University. Although he was already moving toward a career in math or physics, Stallman\'s analytical mind impressed the lab director enough that a few years after Stallman departed for college, Lippman received an unexpected phone call. \"It was the professor at Rockefeller,\" Lippman says. \"He wanted to know how Richard was doing. He was surprised to learn that he was working in computers. He\'d always thought Richard had a great future ahead of him as a biologist.\" Stallman\'s analytical skills impressed faculty members at Columbia as well, even when Stallman himself became a target of their ire. \"Typically once or twice an hour [Stallman] would catch some mistake in the lecture,\" says Breidbart. \"And he was not shy about letting the professors know it immediately. It got him a lot of respect but not much popularity.\" Hearing Breidbart\'s anecdote retold elicits a wry smile from Stallman. \"I may have been a bit of a jerk sometimes,\" he admits. \"But I found kindred spirits among the teachers, because they, too, liked to learn. Kids, for the most part, didn\'t. At least not in the same way.\" Hanging out with the advanced kids on Saturday nevertheless encouraged Stallman to think more about the merits of increased socialization. With college fast approaching, Stallman, like many in his Columbia Science Honors Program, had narrowed his list of desired schools down to two choices: Harvard and MIT. Hearing of her son\'s desire to move on to the Ivy League, Lippman became concerned. As a 15-year-old high-school junior, Stallman was still having run-ins with teachers and administrators. Only the year before, he had pulled straight A\'s in American History, Chemistry, French, and Algebra, but a glaring F in English reflected the ongoing boycott of writing assignments. Such miscues might draw a knowing chuckle at MIT, but at Harvard, they were a red flag. During her son\'s junior year, Lippman says she scheduled an appointment with a therapist. The therapist expressed instant concern over Stallman\'s unwillingness to write papers and his run-ins with teachers. Her son certainly had the intellectual wherewithal to succeed at Harvard, but did he have the patience to sit through college classes that required a term paper? The therapist suggested a trial run. If Stallman could make it through a full year in New York City public schools, including an English class that required term papers, he could probably make it at Harvard. Following the completion of his junior year, Stallman promptly enrolled in summer school at Louis D. Brandeis High School, a public school located on 84th Street, and began making up the mandatory art classes he had shunned earlier in his high-school career. By fall, Stallman was back within the mainstream population of New York City high-school students. It wasn\'t easy sitting through classes that seemed remedial in comparison with his Saturday studies at Columbia, but Lippman recalls proudly her son\'s ability to toe the line. \"He was forced to kowtow to a certain degree, but he did it,\" Lippman says. \"I only got called in once, which was a bit of a miracle. It was the calculus teacher complaining that Richard was interrupting his lesson. I asked how he was interrupting. He said Richard was always accusing the teacher of using a false proof. I said, `Well, is he right?\' The teacher said, `Yeah, but I can\'t tell that to the class. They wouldn\'t understand.\'\" By the end of his first semester at Brandeis, things were falling into place. A 96 in English wiped away much of the stigma of the 60 earned 2 years before. For good measure, Stallman backed it up with top marks in American History, Advanced Placement Calculus, and Microbiology. The crowning touch was a perfect 100 in Physics. Though still a social outcast, Stallman finished his 11 months at Brandeis as the fourth-ranked student in a class of 789. <Graphic file:/home/craigm/books/free_0306.png> Stallman\'s senior-year transcript at Louis D. Brandeis H.S., November, 1969. Note turnaround in English class performance. \"He was forced to kowtow to a certain degree,\" says his mother, \"but he did it.\" Outside the classroom, Stallman pursued his studies with even more diligence, rushing off to fulfill his laboratory-assistant duties at Rockefeller University during the week and dodging the Vietnam protesters on his way to Saturday school at Columbia. It was there, while the rest of the Science Honors Program students sat around discussing their college choices, that Stallman finally took a moment to participate in the preclass bull session. Recalls Breidbart, \"Most of the students were going to Harvard and MIT, of course, but you had a few going to other Ivy League schools. As the conversation circled the room, it became apparent that Richard hadn\'t said anything yet. I don\'t know who it was, but somebody got up the courage to ask him what he planned to do.\" Thirty years later, Breidbart remembers the moment clearly. As soon as Stallman broke the news that he, too, would be attending Harvard University in the fall, an awkward silence filled the room. Almost as if on cue, the corners of Stallman\'s mouth slowly turned upward into a self-satisfied smile. Says Breidbart, \"It was his silent way of saying, `That\'s right. You haven\'t got rid of me yet.\'\" Impeach God Although their relationship was fraught with tension, Richard Stallman would inherit one noteworthy trait from his mother: a passion for progressive politics. It was an inherited trait that would take several decades to emerge, however. For the first few years of his life, Stallman lived in what he now admits was a \"political vacuum.\"See Michael Gross, \"Richard Stallman: High School Misfit, Symbol of Free Software, MacArthur-certified Genius\" (1999). Like most Americans during the Eisenhower age, the Stallman family spent the 50s trying to recapture the normalcy lost during the wartime years of the 1940s. \"Richard\'s father and I were Democrats but happy enough to leave it at that,\" says Lippman, recalling the family\'s years in Queens. \"We didn\'t get involved much in local or national politics.\" That all began to change, however, in the late 1950s when Alice divorced Daniel Stallman. The move back to Manhattan represented more than a change of address; it represented a new, independent identity and a jarring loss of tranquility. \"I think my first taste of political activism came when I went to the Queens public library and discovered there was only a single book on divorce in the whole library,\" recalls Lippman. \"It was very controlled by the Catholic church, at least in Elmhurst, where we lived. I think that was the first inkling I had of the forces that quietly control our lives.\" Returning to her childhood neighborhood, Manhattan\'s Upper West Side, Lippman was shocked by the changes that had taken place since her departure to Hunter College a decade and a half before. The skyrocketing demand for postwar housing had turned the neighborhood into a political battleground. On one side stood the pro-development city-hall politicians and businessmen hoping to rebuild many of the neighborhood\'s blocks to accommodate the growing number of white-collar workers moving into the city. On the other side stood the poor Irish and Puerto Rican tenants who had found an affordable haven in the neighborhood. At first, Lippman didn\'t know which side to choose. As a new resident, she felt the need for new housing. As a single mother with minimal income, however, she shared the poorer tenants\' concern over the growing number of development projects catering mainly to wealthy residents. Indignant, Lippman began looking for ways to combat the political machine that was attempting to turn her neighborhood into a clone of the Upper East Side. Lippman says her first visit to the local Democratic party headquarters came in 1958. Looking for a day-care center to take care of her son while she worked, she had been appalled by the conditions encountered at one of the city-owned centers that catered to low-income residents. \"All I remember is the stench of rotten milk, the dark hallways, the paucity of supplies. I had been a teacher in private nursery schools. The contrast was so great. We took one look at that room and left. That stirred me up.\" The visit to the party headquarters proved disappointing, however. Describing it as \"the proverbial smoke-filled room,\" Lippman says she became aware for the first time that corruption within the party might actually be the reason behind the city\'s thinly disguised hostility toward poor residents. Instead of going back to the headquarters, Lippman decided to join up with one of the many clubs aimed at reforming the Democratic party and ousting the last vestiges of the Tammany Hall machine. Dubbed the Woodrow Wilson/FDR Reform Democratic Club, Lippman and her club began showing up at planning and city-council meetings, demanding a greater say. \"Our primary goal was to fight Tammany Hall, Carmine DeSapio and his henchman,\"Carmine DeSapio holds the dubious distinction of being the first Italian-American boss of Tammany Hall, the New York City political machine. For more information on DeSapio and the politics of post-war New York, see John Davenport, \"Skinning the Tiger: Carmine DeSapio and the End of the Tammany Era,\" New York Affairs (1975): 3:1. says Lippman. \"I was the representative to the city council and was very much involved in creating a viable urban-renewal plan that went beyond simply adding more luxury housing to the neighborhood.\" Such involvement would blossom into greater political activity during the 1960s. By 1965, Lippman had become an \"outspoken\" supporter for political candidates like William Fitts Ryan, a Democratic elected to Congress with the help of reform clubs and one of the first U.S. representatives to speak out against the Vietnam War. It wasn\'t long before Lippman, too, was an outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in Indochina. \"I was against the Vietnam war from the time Kennedy sent troops,\" she says. \"I had read the stories by reporters and journalists sent to cover the early stages of the conflict. I really believed their forecast that it would become a quagmire.\" Such opposition permeated the Stallman-Lippman household. In 1967, Lippman remarried. Her new husband, Maurice Lippman, a major in the Air National Guard, resigned his commission to demonstrate his opposition to the war. Lippman\'s stepson, Andrew Lippman, was at MIT and temporarily eligible for a student deferment. Still, the threat of induction should that deferment disappear, as it eventually did, made the risk of U.S. escalation all the more immediate. Finally, there was Richard who, though younger, faced the prospect of choosing between Vietnam or Canada when the war lasted into the 1970s. \"Vietnam was a major issue in our household,\" says Lippman. \"We talked about it constantly: what would we do if the war continued, what steps Richard or his stepbrother would take if they got drafted. We were all opposed to the war and the draft. We really thought it was immoral.\" For Stallman, the Vietnam War elicited a complex mixture of emotions: confusion, horror, and, ultimately, a profound sense of political impotence. As a kid who could barely cope in the mild authoritarian universe of private school, Stallman experienced a shiver whenever the thought of Army boot camp presented itself. \"I was devastated by the fear, but I couldn\'t imagine what to do and didn\'t have the guts to go demonstrate,\" recalls Stallman, whose March 18th birthday earned him a dreaded low number in the draft lottery when the federal government finally eliminated college deferments in 1971. \"I couldn\'t envision moving to Canada or Sweden. The idea of getting up by myself and moving somewhere. How could I do that? I didn\'t know how to live by myself. I wasn\'t the kind of person who felt confident in approaching things like that.\" Stallman says he was both impressed and shamed by the family members who did speak out. Recalling a bumper sticker on his father\'s car likening the My Lai massacre to similar Nazi atrocities in World War II, he says he was \"excited\" by his father\'s gesture of outrage. \"I admired him for doing it,\" Stallman says. \"But I didn\'t imagine that I could do anything. I was afraid that the juggernaut of the draft was going to destroy me.\" Although descriptions of his own unwillingness to speak out carry a tinge of nostalgic regret, Stallman says he was ultimately turned off by the tone and direction of the anti-war movement. Like other members of the Science Honors Program, he saw the weekend demonstrations at Columbia as little more than a distracting spectacle.Chess, another Columbia Science Honors Program alum, describes the protests as \"background noise.\" \"We were all political,\" he says, \"but the SHP was imporant. We would never have skipped it for a demonstration.\" Ultimately, Stallman says, the irrational forces driving the anti-war movement became indistinguishable from the irrational forces driving the rest of youth culture. Instead of worshiping the Beatles, girls in Stallman\'s age group were suddenly worshiping firebrands like Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. To a kid already struggling to comprehend his teenage peers, escapist slogans like \"make love not war\" had a taunting quality. Not only was it a reminder that Stallman, the short-haired outsider who hated rock \'n\' roll, detested drugs, and didn\'t participate in campus demonstrations, wasn\'t getting it politically; he wasn\'t \"getting it\" sexually either. \"I didn\'t like the counter culture much,\" Stallman admits. \"I didn\'t like the music. I didn\'t like the drugs. I was scared of the drugs. I especially didn\'t like the anti-intellectualism, and I didn\'t like the prejudice against technology. After all, I loved a computer. And I didn\'t like the mindless anti-Americanism that I often encountered. There were people whose thinking was so simplistic that if they disapproved of the conduct of the U.S. in the Vietnam War, they had to support the North Vietnamese. They couldn\'t imagine a more complicated position, I guess.\" Such comments alleviate feelings of timidity. They also underline a trait that would become the key to Stallman\'s own political maturation. For Stallman, political confidence was directly proportionate to personal confidence. By 1970, Stallman had become confident in few things outside the realm of math and science. Nevertheless, confidence in math gave him enough of a foundation to examine the anti-war movement in purely logical terms. In the process of doing so, Stallman had found the logic wanting. Although opposed to the war in Vietnam, Stallman saw no reason to disavow war as a means for defending liberty or correcting injustice. Rather than widen the breach between himself and his peers, however, Stallman elected to keep the analysis to himself. In 1970, Stallman left behind the nightly dinnertime conversations about politics and the Vietnam War as he departed for Harvard. Looking back, Stallman describes the transition from his mother\'s Manhattan apartment to life in a Cambridge dorm as an \"escape.\" Peers who watched Stallman make the transition, however, saw little to suggest a liberating experience. \"He seemed pretty miserable for the first while at Harvard,\" recalls Dan Chess, a classmate in the Science Honors Program who also matriculated at Harvard. \"You could tell that human interaction was really difficult for him, and there was no way of avoiding it at Harvard. Harvard was an intensely social kind of place.\" To ease the transition, Stallman fell back on his strengths: math and science. Like most members of the Science Honors Program, Stallman breezed through the qualifying exam for Math 55, the legendary \"boot camp\" class for freshman mathematics \"concentrators\" at Harvard. Within the class, members of the Science Honors Program formed a durable unit. \"We were the math mafia,\" says Chess with a laugh. \"Harvard was nothing, at least compared with the SHP.\" To earn the right to boast, however, Stallman, Chess, and the other SHP alumni had to get through Math 55. Promising four years worth of math in two semesters, the course favored only the truly devout. \"It was an amazing class,\" says David Harbater, a former \"math mafia\" member and now a professor of mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. \"It\'s probably safe to say there has never been a class for beginning college students that was that intense and that advanced. The phrase I say to people just to get it across is that, among other things, by the second semester we were discussing the differential geometry of Banach manifolds. That\'s usually when their eyes bug out, because most people don\'t start talking about Banach manifolds until their second year of graduate school.\" Starting with 75 students, the class quickly melted down to 20 by the end of the second semester. Of that 20, says Harbater, \"only 10 really knew what they were doing.\" Of that 10, 8 would go on to become future mathematics professors, 1 would go on to teach physics. \"The other one,\" emphasizes Harbater, \"was Richard Stallman.\" Seth Breidbart, a fellow Math 55 classmate, remembers Stallman distinguishing himself from his peers even then. \"He was a stickler in some very strange ways,\" says Breidbart. There is a standard technique in math which everybody does wrong. It\'s an abuse of notation where you have to define a function for something and what you do is you define a function and then you prove that it\'s well defined. Except the first time he did and presented it, he defined a relation and proved that it\'s a function. It\'s the exact same proof, but he used the correct terminology, which no one else did. That\'s just the way he was.\" It was in Math 55 that Richard Stallman began to cultivate a reputation for brilliance. Breidbart agrees, but Chess, whose competitive streak refused to yield, says the realization that Stallman might be the best mathematician in the class didn\'t set in until the next year. \"It was during a class on Real Analysis, which I took with Richard the next year,\" says Chess, now a math professor at Hunter College. \"I actually remember in a proof about complex valued measures that Richard came up with an idea that was basically a metaphor from the calculus of variations. It was the first time I ever saw somebody solve a problem in a brilliantly original way.\" Chess makes no bones about it: watching Stallman\'s solution unfold on the chalkboard was a devastating blow. As a kid who\'d always taken pride in being the smartest mathematician the room, it was like catching a glimpse of his own mortality. Years later, as Chess slowly came to accept the professional rank of a good-but-not-great mathematician, he had Stallman\'s sophomore-year proof to look back on as a taunting early indicator. \"That\'s the thing about mathematics,\" says Chess. \"You don\'t have to be a first-rank mathematician to recognize first-rate mathematical talent. I could tell I was up there, but I could also tell I wasn\'t at the first rank. If Richard had chosen to be a mathematician, he would have been a first-rank mathematician.\" For Stallman, success in the classroom was balanced by the same lack of success in the social arena. Even as other members of the math mafia gathered to take on the Math 55 problem sets, Stallman preferred to work alone. The same went for living arrangements. On the housing application for Harvard, Stallman clearly spelled out his preferences. \"I said I preferred an invisible, inaudible, intangible roommate,\" he says. In a rare stroke of bureaucratic foresight, Harvard\'s housing office accepted the request, giving Stallman a one-room single for his freshman year. Breidbart, the only math-mafia member to share a dorm with Stallman that freshman year, says Stallman slowly but surely learned how to interact with other students. He recalls how other dorm mates, impressed by Stallman\'s logical acumen, began welcoming his input whenever an intellectual debate broke out in the dining club or dorm commons. \"We had the usual bull sessions about solving the world\'s problems or what would be the result of something,\" recalls Breidbart. \"Say somebody discovers an immortality serum. What do you do? What are the political results? If you give it to everybody, the world gets overcrowded and everybody dies. If you limit it, if you say everyone who\'s alive now can have it but their children can\'t, then you end up with an underclass of people without it. Richard was just better able than most to see the unforeseen circumstances of any decision.\" Stallman remembers the discussions vividly. \"I was always in favor of immortality,\" he says. \"I was shocked that most people regarded immortality as a bad thing. How else would we be able to see what the world is like 200 years from now?\" Although a first-rank mathematician and first-rate debater, Stallman shied away from clear-cut competitive events that might have sealed his brilliant reputation. Near the end of freshman year at Harvard, Breidbart recalls how Stallman conspicuously ducked the Putnam exam, a prestigious test open to math students throughout the U.S. and Canada. In addition to giving students a chance to measure their knowledge in relation to their peers, the Putnam served as a chief recruiting tool for academic math departments. According to campus legend, the top scorer automatically qualified for a graduate fellowship at any school of his choice, including Harvard. Like Math 55, the Putnam was a brutal test of merit. A six-hour exam in two parts, it seemed explicitly designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. Breidbart, a veteran of both the Science Honors Program and Math 55, describes it as easily the most difficult test he ever took. \"Just to give you an idea of how difficult it was,\" says Breidbart, \"the top score was a 120, and my score the first year was in the 30s. That score was still good enough to place me 101st in the country.\" Surprised that Stallman, the best student in the class, had passed on the test, Breidbart says he and a fellow classmate cornered him in the dining common and demanded an explanation. \"He said he was afraid of not doing well,\" Breidbart recalls. Breidbart and the friend quickly wrote down a few problems from memory and gave them to Stallman. \"He solved all of them,\" Breidbart says, \"leading me to conclude that by not doing well, he either meant coming in second or getting something wrong.\" Stallman remembers the episode a bit differently. \"I remember that they did bring me the questions and it\'s possible that I solved one of them, but I\'m pretty sure I didn\'t solve them all,\" he says. Nevertheless, Stallman agrees with Breidbart\'s recollection that fear was the primary reason for not taking the test. Despite a demonstrated willingness to point out the intellectual weaknesses of his peers and professors in the classroom, Stallman hated the notion of head-to-head competition. \"It\'s the same reason I never liked chess,\" says Stallman. \"Whenever I\'d play, I would become so consumed by the fear of making a single mistake that I would start making stupid mistakes very early in the game. The fear became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Whether such fears ultimately prompted Stallman to shy away from a mathematical career is a moot issue. By the end of his freshman year at Harvard, Stallman had other interests pulling him away from the field. Computer programming, a latent fascination throughout Stallman\'s high-school years, was becoming a full-fledged passion. Where other math students sought occasional refuge in art and history classes, Stallman sought it in the computer-science laboratory. For Stallman, the first taste of real computer programming at the IBM New York Scientific Center had triggered a desire to learn more. \"Toward the end of my first year at Harvard school, I started to have enough courage to go visit computer labs and see what they had. I\'d ask them if they had extra copies of any manuals that I could read.\" Taking the manuals home, Stallman would examine machine specifications, compare them with other machines he already knew, and concoct a trial program, which he would then bring back to the lab along with the borrowed manual. Although some labs balked at the notion of a strange kid coming off the street and working on the lab machinery, most recognized competence when they saw it and let Stallman run the programs he had created. One day, near the end of freshman year, Stallman heard about a special laboratory near MIT. The laboratory was located on the ninth floor an off-campus building in Tech Square, the newly built facility dedicated to advanced research. According to the rumors, the lab itself was dedicated to the cutting-edge science of artificial intelligence and boasted the cutting-edge machines and software programs to match. Intrigued, Stallman decided to pay a visit. The trip was short, about 2 miles on foot, 10 minutes by train, but as Stallman would soon find out, MIT and Harvard can feel like opposite poles of the same planet. With its maze-like tangle of interconnected office buildings, the Institute\'s campus offered an aesthetic yin to Harvard\'s spacious colonial-village yang. The same could be said for the student body, a geeky collection of ex-high school misfits known more for its predilection for pranks than its politically powerful alumni. The yin-yang relationship extended to the AI Lab as well. Unlike Harvard computer labs, there was no grad-student gatekeeper, no clipboard waiting list for terminal access, no explicit atmosphere of \"look but don\'t touch.\" Instead, Stallman found only a collection of open terminals and robotic arms, presumably the artifacts of some A.I. experiment. Although the rumors said anybody could sit down at the terminals, Stallman decided to stick with the original plan. When he encountered a lab employee, he asked if the lab had any spare manuals it could loan to an inquisitive student. \"They had some, but a lot of things weren\'t documented,\" Stallman recalls. \"They were hackers after all.\" Stallman left with something even better than a manual: a job. Although he doesn\'t remember what the first project was, he does remember coming back to the AI Lab the next week, grabbing an open terminal and writing software code. Looking back, Stallman sees nothing unusual in the AI Lab\'s willingness to accept an unproven outsider at first glance. \"That\'s the way it was back then,\" he says. \"That\'s the way it still is now. I\'ll hire somebody when I meet him if I see he\'s good. Why wait? Stuffy people who insist on putting bureaucracy into everything really miss the point. If a person is good, he shouldn\'t have to go through a long, detailed hiring process; he should be sitting at a computer writing code.\" To get a taste of \"bureaucratic and stuffy,\" Stallman need only visit the computer labs at Harvard. There, access to the terminals was doled out according to academic rank. As an undergrad, Stallman usually had to sign up or wait until midnight, about the time most professors and grad students finished their daily work assignments. The waiting wasn\'t difficult, but it was frustrating. Waiting for a public terminal, knowing all the while that a half dozen equally usable machines were sitting idle inside professors\' locked offices, seemed the height of illogic. Although Stallman paid the occasional visit to the Harvard computer labs, he preferred the more egalitarian policies of the AI Lab. \"It was a breath of fresh air,\" he says. \"At the AI Lab, people seemed more concerned about work than status.\" Stallman quickly learned that the AI Lab\'s first-come, first-served policy owed much to the efforts of a vigilant few. Many were holdovers from the days of Project MAC, the Department of Defense-funded research program that had given birth to the first time-share operating systems. A few were already legends in the computing world. There was Richard Greenblatt, the lab\'s in-house Lisp expert and author of MacHack, the computer chess program that had once humbled A.I. critic Hubert Dreyfus. There was Gerald Sussman, original author of the robotic block-stacking program HACKER. And there was Bill Gosper, the in-house math whiz already in the midst of an 18-month hacking bender triggered by the philosophical implications of the computer game LIFE.See Steven Levy, Hackers (Penguin USA [paperback], 1984): 144. Levy devotes about five pages to describing Gosper\'s fascination with LIFE, a math-based software game first created by British mathematician John Conway. I heartily recommend this book as a supplement, perhaps even a prerequisite, to this one. Members of the tight-knit group called themselves \" hackers.\" Over time, they extended the \"hacker\" description to Stallman as well. In the process of doing so, they inculcated Stallman in the ethical traditions of the \"hacker ethic .\" To be a hacker meant more than just writing programs, Stallman learned. It meant writing the best possible programs. It meant sitting at a terminal for 36 hours straight if that\'s what it took to write the best possible programs. Most importantly, it meant having access to the best possible machines and the most useful information at all times. Hackers spoke openly about changing the world through software, and Stallman learned the instinctual hacker disdain for any obstacle that prevented a hacker from fulfilling this noble cause. Chief among these obstacles were poor software, academic bureaucracy, and selfish behavior. Stallman also learned the lore, stories of how hackers, when presented with an obstacle, had circumvented it in creative ways. Stallman learned about \" lock hacking,\" the art of breaking into professors\' offices to \"liberate\" sequestered terminals. Unlike their pampered Harvard counterparts, MIT faculty members knew better than to treat the AI Lab\'s terminal as private property. If a faculty member made the mistake of locking away a terminal for the night, hackers were quick to correct the error. Hackers were equally quick to send a message if the mistake repeated itself. \"I was actually shown a cart with a heavy cylinder of metal on it that had been used to break down the door of one professor\'s office,\"Gerald Sussman, an MIT faculty member and hacker whose work at the AI Lab predates Stallman\'s, disputes this memory. According to Sussman, the hackers never broke any doors to retrieve terminals. Stallman says. Such methods, while lacking in subtlety, served a purpose. Although professors and administrators outnumbered hackers two-to-one inside the AI Lab, the hacker ethic prevailed. Indeed, by the time of Stallman\'s arrival at the AI Lab, hackers and the AI Lab administration had coevolved into something of a symbiotic relationship. In exchange for fixing the machines and keeping the software up and running, hackers earned the right to work on favorite pet projects. Often, the pet projects revolved around improving the machines and software programs even further. Like teenage hot-rodders, most hackers viewed tinkering with machines as its own form of entertainment. Nowhere was this tinkering impulse better reflected than in the operating system that powered the lab\'s central PDP-6 mini-computer. Dubbed ITS, short for the Incompatible Time Sharing system, the operating system incorporated the hacking ethic into its very design. Hackers had built it as a protest to Project MAC\'s original operating system, the Compatible Time Sharing System, CTSS, and named it accordingly. At the time, hackers felt the CTSS design too restrictive, limiting programmers\' power to modify and improve the program\'s own internal architecture if needed. According to one legend passed down by hackers, the decision to build ITS had political overtones as well. Unlike CTSS, which had been designed for the IBM 7094, ITS was built specifically for the PDP-6. In letting hackers write the systems themselves, AI Lab administrators guaranteed that only hackers would feel comfortable using the PDP-6. In the feudal world of academic research, the gambit worked. Although the PDP-6 was co-owned in conjunction with other departments, A.I. researchers soon had it to themselves. ITS boasted features most commercial operating systems wouldn\'t offer for years, features such as multitasking, debugging, and full-screen editing capability. Using it and the PDP-6 as a foundation, the Lab had been able to declare independence from Project MAC shortly before Stallman\'s arrival.I apologize for the whirlwind summary of ITS\' genesis, an operating system many hackers still regard as the epitome of the hacker ethos. For more information on the program\'s political significance, see Simson Garfinkel, Architects of the Information Society: Thirty-Five Years of the Laboratory for Computer Science at MIT (MIT Press, 1999). As an apprentice hacker, Stallman quickly became enamored with ITS. Although forbidding to most newcomers, the program contained many built-in features that provided a lesson in software development to hacker apprentices such as himself. \"ITS had a very elegant internal mechanism for one program to examine another,\" says Stallman, recalling the program. \"You could examine all sorts of status about another program in a very clean, well-specified way.\" Using this feature, Stallman was able to watch how programs written by hackers processed instructions as they ran. Another favorite feature would allow the monitoring program to freeze the monitored program\'s job between instructions. In other operating systems, such a command would have resulted in half-computed gibberish or an automatic systems crash. In ITS, it provided yet another way to monitor the step-by-step performance. \"If you said, `Stop the job,\' it would always be stopped in user mode. It would be stopped between two user-mode instructions, and everything about the job would be consistent for that point,\" Stallman says. \"If you said, `Resume the job,\' it would continue properly. Not only that, but if you were to change the status of the job and then change it back, everything would be consistent. There was no hidden status anywhere.\" By the end of 1970, hacking at the AI Lab had become a regular part of Stallman\'s weekly schedule. From Monday to Thursday, Stallman devoted his waking hours to his Harvard classes. As soon as Friday afternoon arrived, however, he was on the T, heading down to MIT for the weekend. Stallman usually timed his arrival to coincide with the ritual food run. Joining five or six other hackers in their nightly quest for Chinese food, he would jump inside a beat-up car and head across the Harvard Bridge into nearby Boston. For the next two hours, he and his hacker colleagues would discuss everything from ITS to the internal logic of the Chinese language and pictograph system. Following dinner, the group would return to MIT and hack code until dawn. For the geeky outcast who rarely associated with his high-school peers, it was a heady experience, suddenly hanging out with people who shared the same predilection for computers, science fiction, and Chinese food. \"I remember many sunrises seen from a car coming back from Chinatown,\" Stallman would recall nostalgically, 15 years after the fact in a speech at the Swedish Royal Technical Institute. \"It was actually a very beautiful thing to see a sunrise, \'cause that\'s such a calm time of day. It\'s a wonderful time of day to get ready to go to bed. It\'s so nice to walk home with the light just brightening and the birds starting to chirp; you can get a real feeling of gentle satisfaction, of tranquility about the work that you have done that night.\"See Richard Stallman, \"RMS lecture at KTH (Sweden),\" (October 30, 1986). http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/stallman-kth.html The more Stallman hung out with the hackers, the more he adopted the hacker worldview. Already committed to the notion of personal liberty, Stallman began to infuse his actions with a sense of communal responsibility. When others violated the communal code, Stallman was quick to speak out. Within a year of his first visit, Stallman was the one breaking into locked offices, trying to recover the sequestered terminals that belonged to the lab community as a whole. In true hacker fashion, Stallman also sought to make his own personal contribution to the art of lock hacking. One of the most artful door-opening tricks, commonly attributed to Greenblatt, involved bending a stiff wire into a cane and attaching a loop of tape to the long end. Sliding the wire under the door, a hacker could twist and rotate the wire so that the long end touched the door knob. Provided the adhesive on the tape held, a hacker could open the doorknob with a few sharp twists. When Stallman tried the trick, he found it good but wanting in a few places. Getting the tape to stick wasn\'t always easy, and twisting the wire in a way that turned the doorknob was similarly difficult. Stallman remembered that the hallway ceiling possessed tiles that could be slid away. Some hackers, in fact, had used the false ceiling as a way to get around locked doors, an approach that generally covered the perpetrator in fiberglass but got the job done. Stallman considered an alternative approach. What if, instead of slipping a wire under the door, a hacker slid away one of the panels and stood over the door jamb? Stallman took it upon himself to try it out. Instead of using a wire, Stallman draped out a long U-shaped loop of magnetic tape, fastening a loop of adhesive tape at the base of the U. Standing over the door jamb, he dangled the tape until it looped under the doorknob. Lifting the tape until the adhesive fastened, he then pulled on the left end of the tape, twisting the doorknob counter-clockwise. Sure enough, the door opened. Stallman had added a new twist to the art of lock hacking. \"Sometimes you had to kick the door after you turned the door knob,\" says Stallman, recalling the lingering bugginess of the new method. \"It took a little bit of balance to pull it off.\" Such activities reflected a growing willingness on Stallman\'s part to speak and act out in defense of political beliefs. The AI Lab\'s spirit of direct action had proved inspirational enough for Stallman to break out of the timid impotence of his teenage years. Breaking into an office to free a terminal wasn\'t the same as taking part in a protest march, but it was effective in ways that most protests weren\'t. It solved the problem at hand. By the time of his last years at Harvard, Stallman was beginning to apply the whimsical and irreverent lessons of the AI Lab back at school. \"Did he tell you about the snake?\" his mother asks at one point during an interview. \"He and his dorm mates put a snake up for student election. Apparently it got a considerable number of votes.\" Stallman verifies the snake candidacy with a few caveats. The snake was a candidate for election within Currier House, Stallman\'s dorm, not the campus-wide student council. Stallman does remember the snake attracting a fairly significant number of votes, thanks in large part to the fact that both the snake and its owner both shared the same last name. \"People may have voted for it, because they thought they were voting for the owner,\" Stallman says. \"Campaign posters said that the snake was `slithering for\' the office. We also said it was an `at large\' candidate, since it had climbed into the wall through the ventilating unit a few weeks before and nobody knew where it was.\" Running a snake for dorm council was just one of several election-related pranks. In a later election, Stallman and his dorm mates nominated the house master\'s son. \"His platform was mandatory retirement at age seven,\" Stallman recalls. Such pranks paled in comparison to the fake-candidate pranks on the MIT campus, however. One of the most successful fake-candidate pranks was a cat named Woodstock, which actually managed to outdraw most of the human candidates in a campus-wide election. \"They never announced how many votes Woodstock got, and they treated those votes as spoiled ballots,\" Stallman recalls. \"But the large number of spoiled ballots in that election suggested that Woodstock had actually won. A couple of years later, Woodstock was suspiciously run over by a car. Nobody knows if the driver was working for the MIT administration.\" Stallman says he had nothing to do with Woodstock\'s candidacy, \"but I admired it.\"In an email shortly after this book went into its final edit cycle, Stallman says he drew political inspiration from the Harvard campus as well. \"In my first year of Harvard, in a Chinese History class, I read the story of the first revolt against the Chin dynasty,\" he says. \"The story is not reliable history, but it was very moving.\" At the AI Lab, Stallman\'s political activities had a sharper-edged tone. During the 1970s, hackers faced the constant challenge of faculty members and administrators pulling an end-run around ITS and its hacker-friendly design. One of the first attempts came in the mid-1970s, as more and more faculty members began calling for a file security system to protect research data. Most other computer labs had installed such systems during late 1960s, but the AI Lab, through the insistence of Stallman and other hackers, remained a security-free zone. For Stallman, the opposition to security was both ethical and practical. On the ethical side, Stallman pointed out that the entire art of hacking relied on intellectual openness and trust. On the practical side, he pointed to the internal structure of ITS being built to foster this spirit of openness, and any attempt to reverse that design required a major overhaul. \"The hackers who wrote the Incompatible Timesharing System decided that file protection was usually used by a self-styled system manager to get power over everyone else,\" Stallman would later explain. \"They didn\'t want anyone to be able to get power over them that way, so they didn\'t implement that kind of a feature. The result was, that whenever something in the system was broken, you could always fix it.\"See Richard Stallman (1986). Through such vigilance, hackers managed to keep the AI Lab\'s machines security-free. Over at the nearby MIT Laboratory for Computer Sciences, however, security-minded faculty members won the day. The LCS installed its first password-based system in 1977. Once again, Stallman took it upon himself to correct what he saw as ethical laxity. Gaining access to the software code that controlled the password system, Stallman implanted a software command that sent out a message to any LCS user who attempted to choose a unique password. If a user entered \"starfish,\" for example, the message came back something like: I see you chose the password \"starfish.\" I suggest that you switch to the password \"carriage return.\" It\'s much easier to type, and also it stands up to the principle that there should be no passwords.See Steven Levy, Hackers (Penguin USA [paperback], 1984): 417. I have modified this quote, which Levy also uses as an excerpt, to illustrate more directly how the program might reveal the false security of the system. Levy uses the placeholder \"[such and such].\" Users who did enter \"carriage return\"-that is, users who simply pressed the Enter or Return button, entering a blank string instead of a unique password-left their accounts accessible to the world at large. As scary as that might have been for some users, it reinforced the hacker notion that Institute computers, and even Institute computer files, belonged to the public, not private individuals. Stallman, speaking in an interview for the 1984 book Hackers, proudly noted that one-fifth of the LCS staff accepted this argument and employed the blank-string password.See Steven Levy, Hackers (Penguin USA [paperback], 1984): 417. Stallman\'s null-string crusade would prove ultimately futile. By the early 1980s, even the AI Lab\'s machines were sporting password-based security systems. Even so, it represents a major milestone in terms of Stallman\'s personal and political maturation. To the objective observer familiar with Stallman\'s later career, it offers a convenient inflection point between the timid teenager afraid to speak out even on issues of life-threatening importance and the adult activist who would soon turn needling and cajoling into a full-time occupation. In voicing his opposition to computer security, Stallman drew on many of the forces that had shaped his early life: hunger for knowledge, distaste for authority, and frustration over hidden procedures and rules that rendered some people clueless outcasts. He would also draw on the ethical concepts that would shape his adult life: communal responsibility, trust, and the hacker spirit of direct action. Expressed in software-computing terms, the null string represents the 1.0 version of the Richard Stallman political worldview-incomplete in a few places but, for the most part, fully mature. Looking back, Stallman hesitates to impart too much significance to an event so early in his hacking career. \"In that early stage there were a lot of people who shared my feelings,\" he says. \"The large number of people who adopted the null string as their password was a sign that many people agreed that it was the proper thing to do. I was simply inclined to be an activist about it.\" Stallman does credit the AI Lab for awakening that activist spirit, however. As a teenager, Stallman had observed political events with little idea as to how a single individual could do or say anything of importance. As a young adult, Stallman was speaking out on matters in which he felt supremely confident, matters such as software design, communal responsibility, and individual freedom. \"I joined this community which had a way of life which involved respecting each other\'s freedom,\" he says. \"It didn\'t take me long to figure out that that was a good thing. It took me longer to come to the conclusion that this was a moral issue.\" Hacking at the AI Lab wasn\'t the only activity helping to boost Stallman\'s esteem. During the middle of his sophomore year at Harvard, Stallman had joined up with a dance troupe that specialized in folk dances . What began as a simple attempt to meet women and expand his social horizons soon expanded into yet another passion alongside hacking. Dancing in front of audiences dressed in the native garb of a Balkan peasant, Stallman no longer felt like the awkward, uncoordinated 10-year-old whose attempts to play football had ended in frustration. He felt confident, agile, and alive. For a brief moment, he even felt a hint of emotional connection. He soon found being in front of an audience fun, and it wasn\'t long thereafter that he began craving the performance side of dancing almost as much as the social side. Although the dancing and hacking did little to improve Stallman\'s social standing, they helped him overcome the feelings of weirdness that had clouded his pre-Harvard life. Instead of lamenting his weird nature, Stallman found ways to celebrate it. In 1977, while attending a science-fiction convention, he came across a woman selling custom-made buttons. Excited, Stallman ordered a button with the words \"Impeach God\" emblazoned on it. For Stallman, the \"Impeach God\" message worked on many levels. An atheist since early childhood, Stallman first saw it as an attempt to set a \"second front\" in the ongoing debate on religion. \"Back then everybody was arguing about God being dead or alive,\" Stallman recalls. \"`Impeach God\' approached the subject of God from a completely different viewpoint. If God was so powerful as to create the world and yet do nothing to correct the problems in it, why would we ever want to worship such a God? Wouldn\'t it be better to put him on trial?\" At the same time, \"Impeach God\" was a satirical take on America and the American political system. The Watergate scandal of the 1970s affected Stallman deeply. As a child, Stallman had grown up mistrusting authority. Now, as an adult, his mistrust had been solidified by the culture of the AI Lab hacker community. To the hackers, Watergate was merely a Shakespearean rendition of the daily power struggles that made life such a hassle for those without privilege. It was an outsized parable for what happened when people traded liberty and openness for security and convenience. Buoyed by growing confidence, Stallman wore the button proudly. People curious enough to ask him about it received the same well-prepared spiel. \"My name is Jehovah,\" Stallman would say. \"I have a special plan to save the universe, but because of heavenly security reasons I can\'t tell you what that plan is. You\'re just going to have to put your faith in me, because I see the picture and you don\'t. You know I\'m good because I told you so. If you don\'t believe me, I\'ll throw you on my enemies list and throw you in a pit where Infernal Revenue Service will audit your taxes for eternity.\" Those who interpreted the spiel as a word-for-word parody of the Watergate hearings only got half the message. For Stallman, the other half of the message was something only his fellow hackers seemed to be hearing. One hundred years after Lord Acton warned about absolute power corrupting absolutely, Americans seemed to have forgotten the first part of Acton\'s truism: power, itself, corrupts. Rather than point out the numerous examples of petty corruption, Stallman felt content voicing his outrage toward an entire system that trusted power in the first place. \"I figured why stop with the small fry,\" says Stallman, recalling the button and its message. \"If we went after Nixon, why not going after Mr. Big. The way I see it, any being that has power and abuses it deserves to have that power taken away.\" Small Puddle of Freedom Ask anyone who\'s spent more than a minute in Richard Stallman\'s presence, and you\'ll get the same recollection: forget the long hair. Forget the quirky demeanor. The first thing you notice is the gaze. One look into Stallman\'s green eyes, and you know you\'re in the presence of a true believer. To call the Stallman gaze intense is an understatement. Stallman\'s eyes don\'t just look at you; they look through you. Even when your own eyes momentarily shift away out of simple primate politeness, Stallman\'s eyes remain locked-in, sizzling away at the side of your head like twin photon beams. Maybe that\'s why most writers, when describing Stallman, tend to go for the religious angle. In a 1998 Salon.com article titled \"The Saint of Free Software,\" Andrew Leonard describes Stallman\'s green eyes as \"radiating the power of an Old Testament prophet.\"See Andrew Leonard, \"The Saint of Free Software,\" Salon.com (August 1998). http://www.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/cov_31feature.html  A 1999 Wired magazine article describes the Stallman beard as \"Rasputin-like,\"See Leander Kahney, \"Linux\'s Forgotten Man,\" Wired News (March 5, 1999). http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,18291,00.html  while a London Guardian profile describes the Stallman smile as the smile of \"a disciple seeing Jesus.\"See \"Programmer on moral high ground; Free software is a moral issue for Richard Stallman believes in freedom and free software.\" London Guardian (November 6, 1999). These are just a small sampling of the religious comparisons. To date, the most extreme comparison has to go to Linus Torvalds, who, in his autobiography-see Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidentaly Revolutionary (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 58-writes \"Richard Stallman is the God of Free Software.\" Honorable mention goes to Larry Lessig, who, in a footnote description of Stallman in his book-see Larry Lessig, The Future of Ideas (Random House, 2001): 270-likens Stallman to Moses: . . . as with Moses, it was another leader, Linus Torvalds, who finally carried the movement into the promised land by facilitating the development of the final part of the OS puzzle. Like Moses, too, Stallman is both respected and reviled by allies within the movement. He is [an] unforgiving, and hence for many inspiring, leader of a critically important aspect of modern culture. I have deep respect for the principle and commitment of this extraordinary individual, though I also have great respect for those who are courageous enough to question his thinking and then sustain his wrath. In a final interview with Stallman, I asked him his thoughts about the religious comparisons. \"Some people do compare me with an Old Testament prophent, and the reason is Old Testament prophets said certain social practices were wrong. They wouldn\'t compromise on moral issues. They couldn\'t be bought off, and they were usually treated with contempt.\" Such analogies serve a purpose, but they ultimately fall short. That\'s because they fail to take into account the vulnerable side of the Stallman persona. Watch the Stallman gaze for an extended period of time, and you will begin to notice a subtle change. What appears at first to be an attempt to intimidate or hypnotize reveals itself upon second and third viewing as a frustrated attempt to build and maintain contact. If, as Stallman himself has suspected from time to time, his personality is the product of autism or Asperger Syndrome, his eyes certainly confirm the diagnosis. Even at their most high-beam level of intensity, they have a tendency to grow cloudy and distant, like the eyes of a wounded animal preparing to give up the ghost. My own first encounter with the legendary Stallman gaze dates back to the March, 1999, LinuxWorld Convention and Expo in San Jose, California. Billed as a \"coming out party\" for the Linux software community, the convention also stands out as the event that reintroduced Stallman to the technology media. Determined to push for his proper share of credit, Stallman used the event to instruct spectators and reporters alike on the history of the GNU Project and the project\'s overt political objectives. As a reporter sent to cover the event, I received my own Stallman tutorial during a press conference announcing the release of GNOME 1.0, a free software graphic user interface. Unwittingly, I push an entire bank of hot buttons when I throw out my very first question to Stallman himself: do you think GNOME\'s maturity will affect the commercial popularity of the Linux operating system? \"I ask that you please stop calling the operating system Linux,\" Stallman responds, eyes immediately zeroing in on mine. \"The Linux kernel is just a small part of the operating system. Many of the software programs that make up the operating system you call Linux were not developed by Linus Torvalds at all. They were created by GNU Project volunteers, putting in their own personal time so that users might have a free operating system like the one we have today. To not acknowledge the contribution of those programmers is both impolite and a misrepresentation of history. That\'s why I ask that when you refer to the operating system, please call it by its proper name, GNU/Linux.\" Taking the words down in my reporter\'s notebook, I notice an eerie silence in the crowded room. When I finally look up, I find Stallman\'s unblinking eyes waiting for me. Timidly, a second reporter throws out a question, making sure to use the term \" GNU/Linux\" instead of Linux. Miguel de Icaza, leader of the GNOME project, fields the question. It isn\'t until halfway through de Icaza\'s answer, however, that Stallman\'s eyes finally unlock from mine. As soon as they do, a mild shiver rolls down my back. When Stallman starts lecturing another reporter over a perceived error in diction, I feel a guilty tinge of relief. At least he isn\'t looking at me, I tell myself. For Stallman, such face-to-face moments would serve their purpose. By the end of the first LinuxWorld show, most reporters know better than to use the term \"Linux\" in his presence, and wired.com is running a story comparing Stallman to a pre-Stalinist revolutionary erased from the history books by hackers and entrepreneurs eager to downplay the GNU Project\'s overly political objectives.2 Other articles follow, and while few reporters call the operating system GNU/Linux in print, most are quick to credit Stallman for launching the drive to build a free software operating system 15 years before. I won\'t meet Stallman again for another 17 months. During the interim, Stallman will revisit Silicon Valley once more for the August, 1999 LinuxWorld show. Although not invited to speak, Stallman does managed to deliver the event\'s best line. Accepting the show\'s Linus Torvalds Award for Community Service-an award named after Linux creator Linus Torvalds-on behalf of the Free Software Foundation, Stallman wisecracks, \"Giving the Linus Torvalds Award to the Free Software Foundation is a bit like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Alliance.\" This time around, however, the comments fail to make much of a media dent. Midway through the week, Red Hat, Inc., a prominent GNU/Linux vendor, goes public. The news merely confirms what many reporters such as myself already suspect: \"Linux\" has become a Wall Street buzzword, much like \"e-commerce\" and \"dot-com\" before it. With the stock market approaching the Y2K rollover like a hyperbola approaching its vertical asymptote, all talk of free software or open source as a political phenomenon falls by the wayside. Maybe that\'s why, when LinuxWorld follows up its first two shows with a third LinuxWorld show in August, 2000, Stallman is conspicuously absent. My second encounter with Stallman and his trademark gaze comes shortly after that third LinuxWorld show. Hearing that Stallman is going to be in Silicon Valley, I set up a lunch interview in Palo Alto, California. The meeting place seems ironic, not only because of the recent no-show but also because of the overall backdrop. Outside of Redmond, Washington, few cities offer a more direct testament to the economic value of proprietary software. Curious to see how Stallman, a man who has spent the better part of his life railing against our culture\'s predilection toward greed and selfishness, is coping in a city where even garage-sized bungalows run in the half-million-dollar price range, I make the drive down from Oakland. I follow the directions Stallman has given me, until I reach the headquarters of Art.net, a nonprofit \"virtual artists collective.\" Located in a hedge-shrouded house in the northern corner of the city, the Art.net headquarters are refreshingly run-down. Suddenly, the idea of Stallman lurking in the heart of Silicon Valley doesn\'t seem so strange after all. I find Stallman sitting in a darkened room, tapping away on his gray laptop computer. He looks up as soon as I enter the room, giving me a full blast of his 200-watt gaze. When he offers a soothing \"Hello,\" I offer a return greeting. Before the words come out, however, his eyes have already shifted back to the laptop screen. \"I\'m just finishing an article on the spirit of hacking,\" Stallman says, fingers still tapping. \"Take a look.\" I take a look. The room is dimly lit, and the text appears as greenish-white letters on a black background, a reversal of the color scheme used by most desktop word-processing programs, so it takes my eyes a moment to adjust. When they do, I find myself reading Stallman\'s account of a recent meal at a Korean restaurant. Before the meal, Stallman makes an interesting discovery: the person setting the table has left six chopsticks instead of the usual two in front of Stallman\'s place setting. Where most restaurant goers would have ignored the redundant pairs, Stallman takes it as challenge: find a way to use all six chopsticks at once. Like many software hacks, the successful solution is both clever and silly at the same time. Hence Stallman\'s decision to use it as an illustration. As I read the story, I feel Stallman watching me intently. I look over to notice a proud but child-like half smile on his face. When I praise the essay, my comment barely merits a raised eyebrow. \"I\'ll be ready to go in a moment,\" he says. Stallman goes back to tapping away at his laptop. The laptop is gray and boxy, not like the sleek, modern laptops that seemed to be a programmer favorite at the recent LinuxWorld show. Above the keyboard rides a smaller, lighter keyboard, a testament to Stallman\'s aging hands. During the late 1980s, when Stallman was putting in 70- and 80-hour work weeks writing the first free software tools and programs for the GNU Project, the pain in Stallman\'s hands became so unbearable that he had to hire a typist. Today, Stallman relies on a keyboard whose keys require less pressure than a typical computer keyboard. Stallman has a tendency to block out all external stimuli while working. Watching his eyes lock onto the screen and his fingers dance, one quickly gets the sense of two old friends locked in deep conversation. The session ends with a few loud keystrokes and the slow disassembly of the laptop. \"Ready for lunch?\" Stallman asks. We walk to my car. Pleading a sore ankle, Stallman limps along slowly. Stallman blames the injury on a tendon in his left foot. The injury is three years old and has gotten so bad that Stallman, a huge fan of folk dancing, has been forced to give up all dancing activities. \"I love folk dancing inherently,\" Stallman laments. \"Not being able to dance has been a tragedy for me.\" Stallman\'s body bears witness to the tragedy. Lack of exercise has left Stallman with swollen cheeks and a pot belly that was much less visible the year before. You can tell the weight gain has been dramatic, because when Stallman walks, he arches his back like a pregnant woman trying to accommodate an unfamiliar load. The walk is further slowed by Stallman\'s willingness to stop and smell the roses, literally. Spotting a particularly beautiful blossom, he tickles the innermost petals with his prodigious nose, takes a deep sniff and steps back with a contented sigh. \"Mmm, rhinophytophilia,\"At the time, I thought Stallman was referring to the flower\'s scientific name. Months later, I would learn that rhinophytophilia was in fact a humorous reference to the activity, i.e., Stallman sticking his nose into a flower and enjoying the moment. For another humorous Stallman flower incident, visit: http://www.stallman.org/texas.html he says, rubbing his back. The drive to the restaurant takes less than three minutes. Upon recommendation from Tim Ney, former executive director of the Free Software Foundation, I have let Stallman choose the restaurant. While some reporters zero in on Stallman\'s monk-like lifestyle, the truth is, Stallman is a committed epicure when it comes to food. One of the fringe benefits of being a traveling missionary for the free software cause is the ability to sample delicious food from around the world. \"Visit almost any major city in the world, and chances are Richard knows the best restaurant in town,\" says Ney. \"Richard also takes great pride in knowing what\'s on the menu and ordering for the entire table.\" For today\'s meal, Stallman has chosen a Cantonese-style dim sum restaurant two blocks off University Avenue, Palo Alto\'s main drag. The choice is partially inspired by Stallman\'s recent visit to China, including a lecture stop in Guangdong province, in addition to Stallman\'s personal aversion to spicier Hunanese and Szechuan cuisine. \"I\'m not a big fan of spicy,\" Stallman admits. We arrive a few minutes after 11 a.m. and find ourselves already subject to a 20-minute wait. Given the hacker aversion to lost time, I hold my breath momentarily, fearing an outburst. Stallman, contrary to expectations, takes the news in stride. \"It\'s too bad we couldn\'t have found somebody else to join us,\" he tells me. \"It\'s always more fun to eat with a group of people.\" During the wait, Stallman practices a few dance steps. His moves are tentative but skilled. We discuss current events. Stallman says his only regret about not attending LinuxWorld was missing out on a press conference announcing the launch of the GNOME Foundation. Backed by Sun Microsystems and IBM, the foundation is in many ways a vindication for Stallman, who has long championed that free software and free-market economics need not be mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, Stallman remains dissatisfied by the message that came out. \"The way it was presented, the companies were talking about Linux with no mention of the GNU Project at all,\" Stallman says. Such disappointments merely contrast the warm response coming from overseas, especially Asia, Stallman notes. A quick glance at the Stallman 2000 travel itinerary bespeaks the growing popularity of the free software message. Between recent visits to India, China, and Brazil, Stallman has spent 12 of the last 115 days on United States soil. His travels have given him an opportunity to see how the free software concept translates into different languages of cultures. \"In India many people are interested in free software, because they see it as a way to build their computing infrastructure without spending a lot of money,\" Stallman says. \"In China, the concept has been much slower to catch on. Comparing free software to free speech is harder to do when you don\'t have any free speech. Still, the level of interest in free software during my last visit was profound.\" The conversation shifts to Napster, the San Mateo, California software company, which has become something of a media cause cÈlËbre in recent months. The company markets a controversial software tool that lets music fans browse and copy the music files of other music fans. Thanks to the magnifying powers of the Internet, this so-called \"peer-to-peer\" program has evolved into a de facto online juke box, giving ordinary music fans a way to listen to MP3 music files over the computer without paying a royalty or fee, much to record companies\' chagrin. Although based on proprietary software, the Napster system draws inspiration from the long-held Stallman contention that once a work enters the digital realm-in other words, once making a copy is less a matter of duplicating sounds or duplicating atoms and more a matter of duplicating information-the natural human impulse to share a work becomes harder to restrict. Rather than impose additional restrictions, Napster execs have decided to take advantage of the impulse. Giving music listeners a central place to trade music files, the company has gambled on its ability to steer the resulting user traffic toward other commercial opportunities. The sudden success of the Napster model has put the fear in traditional record companies, with good reason. Just days before my Palo Alto meeting with Stallman, U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel granted a request filed by the Recording Industry Association of America for an injunction against the file-sharing service. The injunction was subsequently suspended by the U.S. Ninth District Court of Appeals, but by early 2001, the Court of Appeals, too, would find the San Mateo-based company in breach of copyright law,5 a decision RIAA spokesperson Hillary Rosen would later proclaim proclaim a \"clear victory for the creative content community and the legitimate online marketplace.\"See \"A Clear Victory for Recording Industry in Napster Case,\" RIAA press release (February 12, 2001). http://www.riaa.com/PR_story.cfm?id=372 For hackers such as Stallman, the Napster business model is scary in different ways. The company\'s eagerness to appropriate time-worn hacker principles such as file sharing and communal information ownership, while at the same time selling a service based on proprietary software, sends a distressing mixed message. As a person who already has a hard enough time getting his own carefully articulated message into the media stream, Stallman is understandably reticent when it comes to speaking out about the company. Still, Stallman does admit to learning a thing or two from the social side of the Napster phenomenon. \"Before Napster, I thought it might be OK for people to privately redistribute works of entertainment,\" Stallman says. \"The number of people who find Napster useful, however, tells me that the right to redistribute copies not only on a neighbor-to-neighbor basis, but to the public at large, is essential and therefore may not be taken away.\" No sooner does Stallman say this than the door to the restaurant swings open and we are invited back inside by the host. Within a few seconds, we are seated in a side corner of the restaurant next to a large mirrored wall. ');

It offers such an interesting texture. I think we should get it.\" This comment leads to an impromptu discussion of Chinese food and Stallman\'s recent visit to China. \"The food in China is utterly exquisite,\" Stallman says, his voice gaining an edge of emotion for the first time this morning. \"So many different things that I\'ve never seen in the U.S., local things made from local mushrooms and local vegetables. It got to the point where I started keeping a journal just to keep track of every wonderful meal.\" The conversation segues into a discussion of Korean cuisine. During the same June, 2000, Asian tour, Stallman paid a visit to South Korea. His arrival ignited a mini-firestorm in the local media thanks to a Korean software conference attended by Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates that same week. Next to getting his photo above Gates\'s photo on the front page of the top Seoul newspaper, Stallman says the best thing about the trip was the food. \"I had a bowl of naeng myun, which is cold noodles,\" says Stallman. \"These were a very interesting feeling noodle. Most places don\'t use quite the same kind of noodles for your naeng myun, so I can say with complete certainty that this was the most exquisite naeng myun I ever had.\" The term \"exquisite\" is high praise coming from Stallman. I know this, because a few moments after listening to Stallman rhapsodize about naeng myun, I feel his laser-beam eyes singeing the top of my right shoulder. \"There is the most exquisite woman sitting just behind you,\" Stallman says. I turn to look, catching a glimpse of a woman\'s back. The woman is young, somewhere in her mid-20s, and is wearing a white sequinned dress. She and her male lunch companion are in the final stages of paying the check. When both get up from the table to leave the restaurant, I can tell without looking, because Stallman\'s eyes suddenly dim in intensity. \"Oh, no,\" he says. \"They\'re gone. And to think, I\'ll probably never even get to see her again.\" After a brief sigh, Stallman recovers. The moment gives me a chance to discuss Stallman\'s reputation vis-ý-vis the fairer sex. The reputation is a bit contradictory at times. A number of hackers report Stallman\'s predilection for greeting females with a kiss on the back of the hand.See Mae Ling Mak, \"Mae Ling\'s Story\" (December 17, 1998). http://www.crackmonkey.org/pipermail/crackmonkey/1998q4/003006.htm So far, Mak is the only person I\'ve found willing to speak on the record in regard to this practice, although I\'ve heard this from a few other female sources. Mak, despite expressing initial revulsion at it, later managed to put aside her misgivings and dance with Stallman at a 1999 LinuxWorld show. http://www.linux.com/interact/potd.phtml?potd_id=44  A May 26, 2000 Salon.com article, meanwhile, portrays Stallman as a bit of a hacker lothario. Documenting the free software-free love connection, reporter Annalee Newitz presents Stallman as rejecting traditional family values, telling her, \"I believe in love, but not monogamy.\"See Annalee Newitz, \"If Code is Free Why Not Me?\" Salon.com (May 26, 2000). Stallman lets his menu drop a little when I bring this up. \"Well, most men seem to want sex and seem to have a rather contemptuous attitude towards women,\" he says. \"Even women they\'re involved with. I can\'t understand it at all.\" I mention a passage from the 1999 book Open Sources in which Stallman confesses to wanting to name the ill-fated GNU kernel after a girlfriend at the time. The girlfriend\'s name was Alix, a name that fit perfectly with the Unix developer convention of putting an \"x\" at the end of any new kernel name-e.g., \"Linux.\" Because the woman was a Unix system administrator, Stallman says it would have been an even more touching tribute. Unfortunately, Stallman notes, the kernel project\'s eventual main developer renamed the kernel HURD.See Richard Stallman, \"The GNU Operating System and the Free Software Movement,\" Open Sources (O\'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1999): 65. Although Stallman and the girlfriend later broke up, the story triggers an automatic question: for all the media imagery depicting him as a wild-eyed fanatic, is Richard Stallman really just a hopeless romantic, a wandering Quixote tilting at corporate windmills in an effort to impress some as-yet-unidentified Dulcinea? \"I wasn\'t really trying to be romantic,\" Stallman says, recalling the Alix story. \"It was more of a teasing thing. I mean, it was romantic, but it was also teasing, you know? It would have been a delightful surprise.\" For the first time all morning, Stallman smiles. I bring up the hand kissing. \"Yes, I do do that,\" Stallman says. \"I\'ve found it\'s a way of offering some affection that a lot of women will enjoy. It\'s a chance to give some affection and to be appreciated for it.\" Affection is a thread that runs clear through Richard Stallman\'s life, and he is painfully candid about it when questions arise. \"There really hasn\'t been much affection in my life, except in my mind,\" he says. Still, the discussion quickly grows awkward. After a few one-word replies, Stallman finally lifts up his menu, cutting off the inquiry. \"Would you like some shimai?\" he asks. When the food comes out, the conversation slaloms between the arriving courses. We discuss the oft-noted hacker affection for Chinese food, the weekly dinner runs into Boston\'s Chinatown district during Stallman\'s days as a staff programmer at the AI Lab, and the underlying logic of the Chinese language and its associated writing system. Each thrust on my part elicits a well-informed parry on Stallman\'s part. \"I heard some people speaking Shanghainese the last time I was in China,\" Stallman says. \"It was interesting to hear. It sounded quite different [from Mandarin]. I had them tell me some cognate words in Mandarin and Shanghainese. In some cases you can see the resemblance, but one question I was wondering about was whether tones would be similar. They\'re not. That\'s interesting to me, because there\'s a theory that the tones evolved from additional syllables that got lost and replaced. Their effect survives in the tone. If that\'s true, and I\'ve seen claims that that happened within historic times, the dialects must have diverged before the loss of these final syllables.\" The first dish, a plate of pan-fried turnip cakes, has arrived. Both Stallman and I take a moment to carve up the large rectangular cakes, which smell like boiled cabbage but taste like potato latkes fried in bacon. I decide to bring up the outcast issue again, wondering if Stallman\'s teenage years conditioned him to take unpopular stands, most notably his uphill battle since 1994 to get computer users and the media to replace the popular term \"Linux\" with \"GNU/Linux.\" \"I believe it did help me,\" Stallman says, chewing on a dumpling. \"I have never understood what peer pressure does to other people. I think the reason is that I was so hopelessly rejected that for me, there wasn\'t anything to gain by trying to follow any of the fads. It wouldn\'t have made any difference. I\'d still be just as rejected, so I didn\'t try.\" Stallman points to his taste in music as a key example of his contrarian tendencies. As a teenager, when most of his high school classmates were listening to Motown and acid rock, Stallman preferred classical music. The memory leads to a rare humorous episode from Stallman\'s middle-school years. Following the Beatles\' 1964 appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, most of Stallman\'s classmates rushed out to purchase the latest Beatles albums and singles. Right then and there, Stallman says, he made a decision to boycott the Fab Four. \"I liked some of the pre-Beatles popular music,\" Stallman says. \"But I didn\'t like the Beatles. I especially disliked the wild way people reacted to them. It was like: who was going to have a Beatles assembly to adulate the Beatles the most?\" When his Beatles boycott failed to take hold, Stallman looked for other ways to point out the herd-mentality of his peers. Stallman says he briefly considered putting together a rock band himself dedicated to satirizing the Liverpool group. \"I wanted to call it Tokyo Rose and the Japanese Beetles.\" Given his current love for international folk music, I ask Stallman if he had a similar affinity for Bob Dylan and the other folk musicians of the early 1960s. Stallman shakes his head. \"I did like Peter, Paul and Mary,\" he says. \"That reminds me of a great filk.\" When I ask for a definition of \"filk,\" Stallman explains the concept. A filk, he says, is a popular song whose lyrics have been replaced with parody lyrics. The process of writing a filk is called filking, and it is a popular activity among hackers and science-fiction aficionados. Classic filks include \"On Top of Spaghetti,\" a rewrite of \"On Top of Old Smokey,\" and \"Yoda,\" filk-master \"Weird\" Al Yankovic\'s Star Wars-oriented rendition of the Kinks tune, \"Lola.\" Stallman asks me if I would be interested in hearing the folk filk. As soon as I say yes, Stallman\'s voice begins singing in an unexpectedly clear tone: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck,If a woodchuck could chuck wood?How many poles could a polak lock,If a polak could lock poles?How many knees could a negro grow,If a negro could grow knees?The answer, my dear, is stick it in your ear.The answer is to stick it in your ear. The singing ends, and Stallman\'s lips curl into another child-like half smile. I glance around at the nearby tables. The Asian families enjoying their Sunday lunch pay little attention to the bearded alto in their midst.For more Stallman filks, visit http://www.stallman.org/doggerel.html. To hear Stallman singing \"The Free Software Song,\" visit http://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.html. After a few moments of hesitation, I finally smile too. \"Do you want that last cornball?\" Stallman asks, eyes twinkling. Before I can screw up the punch line, Stallman grabs the corn-encrusted dumpling with his two chopsticks and lifts it proudly. \"Maybe I\'m the one who should get the cornball,\" he says. The food gone, our conversation assumes the dynamics of a normal interview. Stallman reclines in his chair and cradles a cup of tea in his hands. We resume talking about Napster and its relation to the free software movement. Should the principles of free software be extended to similar arenas such as music publishing? I ask. \"It\'s a mistake to transfer answers from one thing to another,\" says Stallman, contrasting songs with software programs. \"The right approach is to look at each type of work and see what conclusion you get.\" When it comes to copyrighted works, Stallman says he divides the world into three categories. The first category involves \"functional\" works-e.g., software programs, dictionaries, and textbooks. The second category involves works that might best be described as \"testimonial\"-e.g., scientific papers and historical documents. Such works serve a purpose that would be undermined if subsequent readers or authors were free to modify the work at will. The final category involves works of personal expression-e.g., diaries, journals, and autobiographies. To modify such documents would be to alter a person\'s recollections or point of view-action Stallman considers ethically unjustifiable. Of the three categories, the first should give users the unlimited right to make modified versions, while the second and third should regulate that right according to the will of the original author. Regardless of category, however, the freedom to copy and redistribute noncommercially should remain unabridged at all times, Stallman insists. If that means giving Internet users the right to generate a hundred copies of an article, image, song, or book and then email the copies to a hundred strangers, so be it. \"It\'s clear that private occasional redistribution must be permitted, because only a police state can stop that,\" Stallman says. \"It\'s antisocial to come between people and their friends. Napster has convinced me that we also need to permit, must permit, even noncommercial redistribution to the public for the fun of it. Because so many people want to do that and find it so useful.\" When I ask whether the courts would accept such a permissive outlook, Stallman cuts me off. \"That\'s the wrong question,\" he says. \"I mean now you\'ve changed the subject entirely from one of ethics to one of interpreting laws. And those are two totally different questions in the same field. It\'s useless to jump from one to the other. How the courts would interpret the existing laws is mainly in a harsh way, because that\'s the way these laws have been bought by publishers.\" The comment provides an insight into Stallman\'s political philosophy: just because the legal system currently backs up businesses\' ability to treat copyright as the software equivalent of land title doesn\'t mean computer users have to play the game according to those rules. Freedom is an ethical issue, not a legal issue. \"I\'m looking beyond what the existing laws are to what they should be,\" Stallman says. \"I\'m not trying to draft legislation. I\'m thinking about what should the law do? I consider the law prohibiting the sharing of copies with your friend the moral equivalent of Jim Crow. It does not deserve respect.\" The invocation of Jim Crow prompts another question. How much influence or inspiration does Stallman draw from past political leaders? Like the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, his attempt to drive social change is based on an appeal to timeless values: freedom, justice, and fair play. Stallman divides his attention between my analogy and a particularly tangled strand of hair. When I stretch the analogy to the point where I\'m comparing Stallman with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Stallman, after breaking off a split end and popping it into his mouth, cuts me off. \"I\'m not in his league, but I do play the same game,\" he says, chewing. I suggest Malcolm X as another point of comparison. Like the former Nation of Islam spokesperson, Stallman has built up a reputation for courting controversy, alienating potential allies, and preaching a message favoring self-sufficiency over cultural integration. Chewing on another split end, Stallman rejects the comparison. \"My message is closer to King\'s message,\" he says. \"It\'s a universal message. It\'s a message of firm condemnation of certain practices that mistreat others. It\'s not a message of hatred for anyone. And it\'s not aimed at a narrow group of people. I invite anyone to value freedom and to have freedom.\" Even so, a suspicious attitude toward political alliances remains a fundamental Stallman character trait. In the case of his well-publicized distaste for the term \"open source,\" the unwillingness to participate in recent coalition-building projects seems understandable. As a man who has spent the last two decades stumping on the behalf of free software, Stallman\'s political capital is deeply invested in the term. Still, comments such as the \"Han Solo\" wisecrack at the 1999 LinuxWorld have only reinforced the Stallman\'s reputation in the software industry as a disgrunted mossback unwilling to roll with political or marketing trends. \"I admire and respect Richard for all the work he\'s done,\" says Red Hat president Robert Young, summing up Stallman\'s paradoxical political nature. \"My only critique is that sometimes Richard treats his friends worse than his enemies.\" Stallman\'s unwillingness to seek alliances seems equally perplexing when you consider his political interests outside of the free software movement. Visit Stallman\'s offices at MIT, and you instantly find a clearinghouse of left-leaning news articles covering civil-rights abuses around the globe. Visit his web site, and you\'ll find diatribes on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the War on Drugs, and the World Trade Organization. Given his activist tendencies, I ask, why hasn\'t Stallman sought a larger voice? Why hasn\'t he used his visibility in the hacker world as a platform to boost rather than reduce his political voice. Stallman lets his tangled hair drop and contemplates the question for a moment. \"I hesitate to exaggerate the importance of this little puddle of freedom,\" he says. \"Because the more well-known and conventional areas of working for freedom and a better society are tremendously important. I wouldn\'t say that free software is as important as they are. It\'s the responsibility I undertook, because it dropped in my lap and I saw a way I could do something about it. But, for example, to end police brutality, to end the war on drugs, to end the kinds of racism we still have, to help everyone have a comfortable life, to protect the rights of people who do abortions, to protect us from theocracy, these are tremendously important issues, far more important than what I do. I just wish I knew how to do something about them.\" Once again, Stallman presents his political activity as a function of personal confidence. Given the amount of time it has taken him to develop and hone the free software movement\'s core tenets, Stallman is hesitant to jump aboard any issues or trends that might transport him into uncharted territory. \"I wish I knew I how to make a major difference on those bigger issues, because I would be tremendously proud if I could, but they\'re very hard and lots of people who are probably better than I am have been working on them and have gotten only so far,\" he says. \"But as I see it, while other people were defending against these big visible threats, I saw another threat that was unguarded. And so I went to defend against that threat. It may not be as big a threat, but I was the only one there.\" Chewing a final split end, Stallman suggests paying the check. Before the waiter can take it away, however, Stallman pulls out a white-colored dollar bill and throws it on the pile. The bill looks so clearly counterfeit, I can\'t help but pick it up and read it. Sure enough, it is counterfeit. Instead of bearing the image of a George Washington or Abe Lincoln, the bill\'s front side bears the image of a cartoon pig. Instead of the United States of America, the banner above the pig reads \"United Swines of Avarice.\" The bill is for zero dollars, and when the waiter picks up the money, Stallman makes sure to tug on his sleeve. \"I added an extra zero to your tip,\" Stallman says, yet another half smile creeping across his lips. The waiter, uncomprehending or fooled by the look of the bill, smiles and scurries away. \"I think that means we\'re free to go,\" Stallman says. The Emacs Commune The AI Lab of the 1970s was by all accounts a special place. Cutting-edge projects and top-flight researchers gave it an esteemed position in the world of computer science. The internal hacker culture and its anarchic policies lent a rebellious mystique as well. Only later, when many of the lab\'s scientists and software superstars had departed, would hackers fully realize the unique and ephemeral world they had once inhabited. \"It was a bit like the Garden of Eden,\" says Stallman, summing up the lab and its software-sharing ethos in a 1998 Forbes article. \"It hadn\'t occurred to us not to cooperate.\"See Josh McHugh, \"For the Love of Hacking,\" Forbes (August 10, 1998). http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1998/0810/6203094a.html Such mythological descriptions, while extreme, underline an important fact. The ninth floor of 545 Tech Square was more than a workplace for many. For hackers such as Stallman, it was home. The word \"home\" is a weighted term in the Stallman lexicon. In a pointed swipe at his parents, Stallman, to this day, refuses to acknowledge any home before Currier House, the dorm he lived in during his days at Harvard. He has also been known to describe leaving that home in tragicomic terms. Once, while describing his years at Harvard, Stallman said his only regret was getting kicked out. It wasn\'t until I asked Stallman what precipitated his ouster, that I realized I had walked into a classic Stallman setup line. \"At Harvard they have this policy where if you pass too many classes they ask you to leave,\" Stallman says. With no dorm and no desire to return to New York, Stallman followed a path blazed by Greenblatt, Gosper, Sussman, and the many other hackers before him. Enrolling at MIT as a grad student, Stallman rented an apartment in nearby Cambridge but soon viewed the AI Lab itself as his de facto home. In a 1986 speech, Stallman recalled his memories of the AI Lab during this period: I may have done a little bit more living at the lab than most people, because every year or two for some reason or other I\'d have no apartment and I would spend a few months living at the lab. And I\'ve always found it very comfortable, as well as nice and cool in the summer. But it was not at all uncommon to find people falling asleep at the lab, again because of their enthusiasm; you stay up as long as you possibly can hacking, because you just don\'t want to stop. And then when you\'re completely exhausted, you climb over to the nearest soft horizontal surface. A very informal atmosphere.See Stallman (1986). The lab\'s home-like atmosphere could be a problem at times. What some saw as a dorm, others viewed as an electronic opium den. In the 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason, MIT researcher Joseph Weizenbaum offered a withering critique of the \" computer bum,\" Weizenbaum\'s term for the hackers who populated computer rooms such as the AI Lab. \"Their rumpled clothes, their unwashed hair and unshaved faces, and their uncombed hair all testify that they are oblivious to their bodies and to the world in which they move,\" Weizenbaum wrote. \"[Computer bums] exist, at least when so engaged, only through and for the computers.\"See Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation (W. H. Freeman, 1976): 116. Almost a quarter century after its publication, Stallman still bristles when hearing Weizenbaum\'s \"computer bum\" description, discussing it in the present tense as if Weizenbaum himself was still in the room. \"He wants people to be just professionals, doing it for the money and wanting to get away from it and forget about it as soon as possible,\" Stallman says. \"What he sees as a normal state of affairs, I see as a tragedy.\" Hacker life, however, was not without tragedy. Stallman characterizes his transition from weekend hacker to full-time AI Lab denizen as a series of painful misfortunes that could only be eased through the euphoria of hacking. As Stallman himself has said, the first misfortune was his graduation from Harvard. Eager to continue his studies in physics, Stallman enrolled as a graduate student at MIT. The choice of schools was a natural one. Not only did it give Stallman the chance to follow the footsteps of great MIT alumni: William Shockley (\'36), Richard P. Feynman (\'39), and Murray Gell-Mann (\'51), it also put him two miles closer to the AI Lab and its new PDP-10 computer. \"My attention was going toward programming, but I still thought, well, maybe I can do both,\" Stallman says. Toiling in the fields of graduate-level science by day and programming in the monastic confines of the AI Lab by night, Stallman tried to achieve a perfect balance. The fulcrum of this geek teeter-totter was his weekly outing with the folk-dance troupe, his one social outlet that guaranteed at least a modicum of interaction with the opposite sex. Near the end of that first year at MIT, however, disaster struck. A knee injury forced Stallman to drop out of the troupe. At first, Stallman viewed the injury as a temporary problem, devoting the spare time he would have spent dancing to working at the AI Lab even more. By the end of the summer, when the knee still ached and classes reconvened, Stallman began to worry. \"My knee wasn\'t getting any better,\" Stallman recalls, \"which meant I had to stop dancing completely. I was heartbroken.\" With no dorm and no dancing, Stallman\'s social universe imploded. Like an astronaut experiencing the aftereffects of zero-gravity, Stallman found that his ability to interact with nonhackers, especially female nonhackers, had atrophied significantly. After 16 weeks in the AI Lab, the self confidence he\'d been quietly accumulating during his 4 years at Harvard was virtually gone. \"I felt basically that I\'d lost all my energy,\" Stallman recalls. \"I\'d lost my energy to do anything but what was most immediately tempting. The energy to do something else was gone. I was in total despair.\" Stallman retreated from the world even further, focusing entirely on his work at the AI Lab. By October, 1975, he dropped out of MIT, never to go back. Software hacking, once a hobby, had become his calling. Looking back on that period, Stallman sees the transition from full-time student to full-time hacker as inevitable. Sooner or later, he believes, the siren\'s call of computer hacking would have overpowered his interest in other professional pursuits. \"With physics and math, I could never figure out a way to contribute,\" says Stallman, recalling his struggles prior to the knee injury. \"I would have been proud to advance either one of those fields, but I could never see a way to do that. I didn\'t know where to start. With software, I saw right away how to write things that would run and be useful. The pleasure of that knowledge led me to want to do it more.\" Stallman wasn\'t the first to equate hacking with pleasure. Many of the hackers who staffed the AI Lab boasted similar, incomplete academic rÈsumÈs. Most had come in pursuing degrees in math or electrical engineering only to surrender their academic careers and professional ambitions to the sheer exhilaration that came with solving problems never before addressed. Like St. Thomas Aquinas, the scholastic known for working so long on his theological summae that he sometimes achieved spiritual visions, hackers reached transcendent internal states through sheer mental focus and physical exhaustion. Although Stallman shunned drugs, like most hackers, he enjoyed the \"high\" that came near the end of a 20-hour coding bender. Perhaps the most enjoyable emotion, however, was the sense of personal fulfillment. When it came to hacking, Stallman was a natural. A childhood\'s worth of late-night study sessions gave him the ability to work long hours with little sleep. As a social outcast since age 10, he had little difficulty working alone. And as a mathematician with built-in gift for logic and foresight, Stallman possessed the ability to circumvent design barriers that left most hackers spinning their wheels. \"He was special,\" recalls Gerald Sussman, an MIT faculty member and former AI Lab researcher. Describing Stallman as a \"clear thinker and a clear designer,\" Sussman employed Stallman as a research-project assistant beginning in 1975. The project was complex, involving the creation of an AI program that could analyze circuit diagrams. Not only did it involve an expert\'s command of Lisp, a programming language built specifically for AI applications, but it also required an understanding of how a human might approach the same task. When he wasn\'t working on official projects such as Sussman\'s automated circuit-analysis program, Stallman devoted his time to pet projects. It was in a hacker\'s best interest to improve the lab\'s software infrastructure, and one of Stallman\'s biggest pet projects during this period was the lab\'s editor program TECO. The story of Stallman\'s work on TECO during the 1970s is inextricably linked with Stallman\'s later leadership of the free software movement. It is also a significant stage in the history of computer evolution, so much so that a brief recapitulation of that evolution is necessary. During the 1950s and 1960s, when computers were first appearing at universities, computer programming was an incredibly abstract pursuit. To communicate with the machine, programmers created a series of punch cards, with each card representing an individual software command. Programmers would then hand the cards over to a central system administrator who would then insert them, one by one, into the machine, waiting for the machine to spit out a new set of punch cards, which the programmer would then decipher as output. This process, known as \" batch processing,\" was cumbersome and time consuming. It was also prone to abuses of authority. One of the motivating factors behind hackers\' inbred aversion to centralization was the power held by early system operators in dictating which jobs held top priority. In 1962, computer scientists and hackers involved in MIT\'s Project MAC, an early forerunner of the AI Lab, took steps to alleviate this frustration. Time-sharing, originally known as \"time stealing,\" made it possible for multiple programs to take advantage of a machine\'s operational capabilities. Teletype interfaces also made it possible to communicate with a machine not through a series of punched holes but through actual text. A programmer typed in commands and read the line-by-line output generated by the machine. During the late 1960s, interface design made additional leaps. In a famous 1968 lecture, Doug Engelbart, a scientist then working at the Stanford Research Institute, unveiled a prototype of the modern graphical interface. Rigging up a television set to the computer and adding a pointer device which Engelbart dubbed a \" mouse,\" the scientist created a system even more interactive than the time-sharing system developed a MIT. Treating the video display like a high-speed printer, Engelbart\'s system gave a user the ability to move the cursor around the screen and see the cursor position updated by the computer in real time. The user suddenly had the ability to position text anywhere on the screen. Such innovations would take another two decades to make their way into the commercial marketplace. Still, by the 1970s, video screens had started to replace teletypes as display terminals, creating the potential for full-screen-as opposed to line-by-line-editing capabilities. One of the first programs to take advantage of this full-screen capability was the MIT AI Lab\'s TECO. Short for Text Editor and COrrector, the program had been upgraded by hackers from an old teletype line editor for the lab\'s PDP-6 machine.ccording to the Jargon File, TECO\'s name originally stood for Tape Editor and Corrector. TECO was a substantial improvement over old editors, but it still had its drawbacks. To create and edit a document, a programmer had to enter a series of software commands specifying each edit. It was an abstract process. Unlike modern word processors, which update text with each keystroke, TECO demanded that the user enter an extended series of editing instructions followed by an \"end of command\" sequence just to change the text.Over time, a hacker grew proficient enough to write entire documents in edit mode, but as Stallman himself would later point out, the process required \"a mental skill like that of blindfold chess.\"See Richard Stallman, \"EMACS: The Extensible, Customizable, Display Editor,\" AI Lab Memo (1979). An updated HTML version of this memo, from which I am quoting, is available at http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html. To facilitate the process, AI Lab hackers had built a system that displayed both the \"source\" and \"display\" modes on a split screen. Despite this innovative hack, switching from mode to mode was still a nuisance. TECO wasn\'t the only full-screen editor floating around the computer world at this time. During a visit to the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1976, Stallman encountered an edit program named E. The program contained an internal feature, which allowed a user to update display text after each command keystroke. In the language of 1970s programming, E was one of the first rudimentary WYSIWYG editors. Short for \"what you see is what you get,\" WYSIWYG meant that a user could manipulate the file by moving through the displayed text, as opposed to working through a back-end editor program.\"See Richard Stallman, \"Emacs the Full Screen Editor\" (1987). http://www.lysator.liu.se/history/garb/txt/87-1-emacs.txt Impressed by the hack, Stallman looked for ways to expand TECO\'s functionality in similar fashion upon his return to MIT. He found a TECO feature called Control-R, written by Carl Mikkelson and named after the two-key combination that triggered it. Mikkelson\'s hack switched TECO from its usual abstract command-execution mode to a more intuitive keystroke-by-keystroke mode. Stallman revised the feature in a subtle but significant way. He made it possible to trigger other TECO command strings, or \" macros,\" using other, two-key combinations. Where users had once entered command strings and discarded them after entering then, Stallman\'s hack made it possible to save macro tricks on file and call them up at will. Mikkelson\'s hack had raised TECO to the level of a WYSIWYG editor. Stallman\'s hack had raised it to the level of a user-programmable WYSIWYG editor. \"That was the real breakthrough,\" says Guy Steele, a fellow AI Lab hacker at the time. By Stallman\'s own recollection, the macro hack touched off an explosion of further innovation. \"Everybody and his brother was writing his own collection of redefined screen-editor commands, a command for everything he typically liked to do,\" Stallman would later recall. \"People would pass them around and improve them, making them more powerful and more general. The collections of redefinitions gradually became system programs in their own right.\" So many people found the macro innovations useful and had incorporated it into their own TECO programs that the TECO editor had become secondary to the macro mania it inspired. \"We started to categorize it mentally as a programming language rather than as an editor,\" Stallman says. Users were experiencing their own pleasure tweaking the software and trading new ideas. Two years after the explosion, the rate of innovation began to exhibit dangerous side effects. The explosive growth had provided an exciting validation of the collaborative hacker approach, but it had also led to over-complexity. \"We had a Tower of Babel effect,\" says Guy Steele. The effect threatened to kill the spirit that had created it, Steele says. Hackers had designed ITS to facilitate programmers\' ability to share knowledge and improve each other\'s work. That meant being able to sit down at another programmer\'s desk, open up a programmer\'s work and make comments and modifications directly within the software. \"Sometimes the easiest way to show somebody how to program or debug something was simply to sit down at the terminal and do it for them,\" explains Steele. The macro feature, after its second year, began to foil this capability. In their eagerness to embrace the new full-screen capabilities, hackers had customized their versions of TECO to the point where a hacker sitting down at another hacker\'s terminal usually had to spend the first hour just figuring out what macro commands did what. Frustrated, Steele took it upon himself to the solve the problem. He gathered together the four different macro packages and began assembling a chart documenting the most useful macro commands. In the course of implementing the design specified by the chart, Steele says he attracted Stallman\'s attention. \"He started looking over my shoulder, asking me what I was doing,\" recalls Steele. For Steele, a soft-spoken hacker who interacted with Stallman infrequently, the memory still sticks out. Looking over another hacker\'s shoulder while he worked was a common activity at the AI Lab. Stallman, the TECO maintainer at the lab, deemed Steele\'s work \"interesting\" and quickly set off to complete it. \"As I like to say, I did the first 0.001 percent of the implementation, and Stallman did the rest,\" says Steele with a laugh. The project\'s new name, Emacs, came courtesy of Stallman. Short for \"editing macros,\" it signified the evolutionary transcendence that had taken place during the macros explosion two years before. It also took advantage of a gap in the software programming lexicon. Noting a lack of programs on ITS starting with the letter \"E,\" Stallman chose Emacs, making it possible to reference the program with a single letter. Once again, the hacker lust for efficiency had left its mark. In the course of developing a standard system of macro commands, Stallman and Steele had to traverse a political tightrope. In creating a standard program, Stallman was in clear violation of the fundamental hacker tenet-\"promote decentralization.\" He was also threatening to hobble the very flexibility that had fueled TECO\'s explosive innovation in the first place. \"On the one hand, we were trying to make a uniform command set again; on the other hand, we wanted to keep it open ended, because the programmability was important,\" recalls Steele. To solve the problem, Stallman, Steele, and fellow hackers David Moon and Dan Weinreib limited their standardization effort to the WYSIWYG commands that controlled how text appeared on-screen. The rest of the Emacs effort would be devoted to retaining the program\'s Tinker Toy-style extensibility. Stallman now faced another conundrum: if users made changes but didn\'t communicate those changes back to the rest of the community, the Tower of Babel effect would simply emerge in other places. Falling back on the hacker doctrine of sharing innovation, Stallman embedded a statement within the source code that set the terms of use. Users were free to modify and redistribute the code on the condition that they gave back all the extensions they made. Stallman dubbed it the \" Emacs Commune.\" Just as TECO had become more than a simple editor, Emacs had become more than a simple software program. To Stallman, it was a social contract. In an early memo documenting the project, Stallman spelled out the contract terms. \"EMACS,\" he wrote, \"was distributed on a basis of communal sharing, which means that all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and distributed.\"See Stallman (1979): #SEC34. Not everybody accepted the contract. The explosive innovation continued throughout the decade, resulting in a host of Emacs-like programs with varying degrees of cross-compatibility. A few cited their relation to Stallman\'s original Emacs with humorously recursive names: Sine (Sine is not Emacs), Eine (Eine is not Emacs), and Zwei (Zwei was Eine initially). As a devoted exponent of the hacker ethic, Stallman saw no reason to halt this innovation through legal harassment. Still, the fact that some people would so eagerly take software from the community chest, alter it, and slap a new name on the resulting software displayed a stunning lack of courtesy. Such rude behavior was reflected against other, unsettling developments in the hacker community. Brian Reid\'s 1979 decision to embed \"time bombs\" in Scribe, making it possible for Unilogic to limit unpaid user access to the software, was a dark omen to Stallman. \"He considered it the most Nazi thing he ever saw in his life,\" recalls Reid. Despite going on to later Internet fame as the cocreator of the Usenet alt heirarchy, Reid says he still has yet to live down that 1979 decision, at least in Stallman\'s eyes. \"He said that all software should be free and the prospect of charging money for software was a crime against humanity.\"In a 1996 interview with online magazine MEME , Stallman cited Scribe\'s sale as irksome, but hesitated to mention Reid by name. \"The problem was nobody censured or punished this student for what he did,\" Stallman said. \"The result was other people got tempted to follow his example.\" See MEME 2.04. http://memex.org/meme2-04.html Although Stallman had been powerless to head off Reid\'s sale, he did possess the ability to curtail other forms of behavior deemed contrary to the hacker ethos. As central source-code maintainer for the Emacs \"commune,\" Stallman began to wield his power for political effect. During his final stages of conflict with the administrators at the Laboratory for Computer Science over password systems, Stallman initiated a software \" strike,\"See Steven Levy, Hackers (Penguin USA [paperback], 1984): 419. refusing to send lab members the latest version of Emacs until they rejected the security system on the lab\'s computers. The move did little to improve Stallman\'s growing reputation as an extremist, but it got the point across: commune members were expected to speak up for basic hacker values. \"A lot of people were angry with me, saying I was trying to hold them hostage or blackmail them, which in a sense I was,\" Stallman would later tell author Steven Levy. \"I was engaging in violence against them because I thought they were engaging in violence to everyone at large.\" Over time, Emacs became a sales tool for the hacker ethic. The flexibility Stallman and built into the software not only encouraged collaboration, it demanded it. Users who didn\'t keep abreast of the latest developments in Emacs evolution or didn\'t contribute their contributions back to Stallman ran the risk of missing out on the latest breakthroughs. And the breakthroughs were many. Twenty years later, users had modified Emacs for so many different uses-using it as a spreadsheet, calculator, database, and web browser-that later Emacs developers adopted an overflowing sink to represent its versatile functionality. \"That\'s the idea that we wanted to convey,\" says Stallman. \"The amount of stuff it has contained within it is both wonderful and awful at the same time.\" Stallman\'s AI Lab contemporaries are more charitable. Hal Abelson, an MIT grad student who worked with Stallman during the 1970s and would later assist Stallman as a charter boardmember of the Free Software Foundation, describes Emacs as \"an absolutely brilliant creation.\" In giving programmers a way to add new software libraries and features without messing up the system, Abelson says, Stallman paved the way for future large-scale collaborative software projects. \"Its structure was robust enough that you\'d have people all over the world who were loosely collaborating [and] contributing to it,\" Abelson says. \"I don\'t know if that had been done before.\"In writing this chapter, I\'ve elected to focus more on the social significance of Emacs than the software significance. To read more about the software side, I recommend Stallman\'s 1979 memo. I particularly recommend the section titled \"Research Through Development of Installed Tools\" (#SEC27). Not only is it accessible to the nontechnical reader, it also sheds light on how closely intertwined Stallman\'s political philosophies are with his software-design philosophies. A sample excerpt follows: EMACS could not have been reached by a process of careful design, because such processes arrive only at goals which are visible at the outset, and whose desirability is established on the bottom line at the outset. Neither I nor anyone else visualized an extensible editor until I had made one, nor appreciated its value until he had experienced it. EMACS exists because I felt free to make individually useful small improvements on a path whose end was not in sight. Guy Steele expresses similar admiration. Currently a research scientist for Sun Microsystems, he remembers Stallman primarily as a \"brilliant programmer with the ability to generate large quantities of relatively bug-free code.\" Although their personalities didn\'t exactly mesh, Steele and Stallman collaborated long enough for Steele to get a glimpse of Stallman\'s intense coding style. He recalls a notable episode in the late 1970s when the two programmers banded together to write the editor\'s \"pretty print\" feature. Originally conceived by Steele, pretty print was another keystroke-triggerd feature that reformatted Emacs\' source code so that it was both more readable and took up less space, further bolstering the program\'s WYSIWIG qualities. The feature was strategic enough to attract Stallman\'s active interest, and it wasn\'t long before Steele wrote that he and Stallman were planning an improved version. \"We sat down one morning,\" recalls Steele. \"I was at the keyboard, and he was at my elbow,\" says Steele. \"He was perfectly willing to let me type, but he was also telling me what to type. The programming session lasted 10 hours. Throughout that entire time, Steele says, neither he nor Stallman took a break or made any small talk. By the end of the session, they had managed to hack the pretty print source code to just under 100 lines. \"My fingers were on the keyboard the whole time,\" Steele recalls, \"but it felt like both of our ideas were flowing onto the screen. He told me what to type, and I typed it.\" The length of the session revealed itself when Steele finally left the AI Lab. Standing outside the building at 545 Tech Square, he was surprised to find himself surrounded by nighttime darkness. As a programmer, Steele was used to marathon coding sessions. Still, something about this session was different. Working with Stallman had forced Steele to block out all external stimuli and focus his entire mental energies on the task at hand. Looking back, Steele says he found the Stallman mind-meld both exhilarating and scary at the same time. \"My first thought afterward was: it was a great experience, very intense, and that I never wanted to do it again in my life.\" A Stark Moral Choice On September 27, 1983, computer programmers logging on to the Usenet newsgroup net.unix-wizards encountered an unusual message. Posted in the small hours of the morning, 12:30 a.m. to be exact, and signed by rms@mit-oz , the message\'s subject line was terse but attention-grabbing. \"New UNIX implementation,\" it read. Instead of introducing a newly released version of Unix, however, the message\'s opening paragraph issued a call to arms: Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu\'s Not Unix), and give it away free to everyone who can use it. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.1 To an experienced Unix developer, the message was a mixture of idealism and hubris. Not only did the author pledge to rebuild the already mature Unix operating system from the ground up, he also proposed to improve it in places. The new GNU system, the author predicted, would carry all the usual components-a text editor, a shell program to run Unix-compatible applications, a compiler, \"and a few other things.\"See Richard Stallman, \"Initial GNU Announcement\" (September 1983). http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/initial-announcement.html It would also contain many enticing features that other Unix systems didn\'t yet offer: a graphic user interface based on the Lisp programming language, a crash-proof file system, and networking protocols built according to MIT\'s internal networking system. \"GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix,\" the author wrote. \"We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience with other operating systems.\" Anticipating a skeptical response on some readers\' part, the author made sure to follow up his operating-system outline with a brief biographical sketch titled, \"Who am I?\": I am Richard Stallman, inventor of the original much-imitated EMACS editor, now at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. I have worked extensively on compilers, editors, debuggers, command interpreters, the Incompatible Timesharing System and the Lisp Machine operating system. I pioneered terminal-independent display support in ITS. In addition I have implemented one crashproof file system and two window systems for Lisp machines. As fate would have it, Stallman\'s fanciful GNU Project missed its Thanksgiving launch date. By January, 1984, however, Stallman made good on his promise and fully immersed himself in the world of Unix software development. For a software architect raised on ITS, it was like designing suburban shopping malls instead of Moorish palaces. Even so, building a Unix-like operating system had its hidden advantages. ITS had been powerful, but it also possessed an Achilles\' heel: MIT hackers had designed it to take specific advantage of the DEC-built PDP line. When AI Lab administrators elected to phase out the lab\'s powerful PDP-10 machine in the early 1980s, the operating system that hackers once likened to a vibrant city became an instant ghost town. Unix, on the other hand, was designed for mobility and long-term survival. Originally developed by junior scientists at AT&T, the program had slipped out under corporate-management radar, finding a happy home in the cash-strapped world of academic computer systems. With fewer resources than their MIT brethren, Unix developers had customized the software to ride atop a motley assortment of hardware systems: everything from the 16-bit PDP-11-a machine considered fit for only small tasks by most AI Lab hackers-to 32-bit mainframes such as the VAX 11/780. By 1983, a few companies, most notably Sun Microsystems, were even going so far as to develop a new generation of microcomputers, dubbed \"workstations,\" to take advantage of the increasingly ubiquitous operating system. To facilitate this process, the developers in charge of designing the dominant Unix strains made sure to keep an extra layer of abstraction between the software and the machine. Instead of tailoring the operating system to take advantage of a specific machine\'s resources-as the AI Lab hackers had done with ITS and the PDP-10-Unix developers favored a more generic, off-the-rack approach. Focusing more on the interlocking standards and specifications that held the operating system\'s many subcomponents together, rather than the actual components themselves, they created a system that could be quickly modified to suit the tastes of any machine. If a user quibbled with a certain portion, the standards made it possible to pull out an individual subcomponent and either fix it or replace it with something better. Simply put, what the Unix approach lacked in terms of style or aesthetics, it more than made up for in terms of flexibility and economy, hence its rapid adoption.See Marshall Kirk McKusick, \"Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix,\" Open Sources (O\'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1999): 38. Stallman\'s decision to start developing the GNU system was triggered by the end of the ITS system that the AI Lab hackers had nurtured for so long. The demise of ITS had been a traumatic blow to Stallman. Coming on the heels of the Xerox laser printer episode, it offered further evidence that the AI Lab hacker culture was losing its immunity to business practices in the outside world. Like the software code that composed it, the roots of ITS\' demise stretched way back. Defense spending, long a major font for computer-science research, had dried up during the post-Vietnam years. In a desperate quest for new funds, laboratories and universities turned to the private sector. In the case of the AI Lab, winning over private investors was an easy sell. Home to some of the most ambitious computer-science projects of the post-war era, the lab became a quick incubator of technology. Indeed, by 1980, most of the lab\'s staff, including many hackers, were dividing its time between Institute and commercial projects. What at first seemed like a win-win deal-hackers got to work on the best projects, giving the lab first look at many of the newest computer technologies coming down the pike-soon revealed itself as a Faustian bargain. The more time hackers devoted to cutting-edge commercial projects, the less time they had to devote to general maintenance on the lab\'s baroque software infrastructure. Soon, companies began hiring away hackers outright in an attempt to monopolize their time and attention. With fewer hackers to mind the shop, programs and machines took longer to fix. Even worse, Stallman says, the lab began to undergo a \"demographic change.\" The hackers who had once formed a vocal minority within the AI Lab were losing membership while \"the professors and the students who didn\'t really love the [PDP-10] were just as numerous as before.\"See Richard Stallman (1986). The breaking point came in 1982. That was the year the lab\'s administration decided to upgrade its main computer, the PDP-10. Digital, the corporation that manufactured the PDP-10, had discontinued the line. Although the company still offered a high-powered mainframe, dubbed the KL-10, the new machine required a drastic rewrite or \"port\" of ITS if hackers wanted to continue running the same operating system. Fearful that the lab had lost its critical mass of in-house programming talent, AI Lab faculty members pressed for Twenex, a commercial operating system developed by Digital. Outnumbered, the hackers had no choice but to comply. \"Without hackers to maintain the system, [faculty members] said, `We\'re going to have a disaster; we must have commercial software,\'\" Stallman would recall a few years later. \"They said, `We can expect the company to maintain it.\' It proved that they were utterly wrong, but that\'s what they did.\" At first, hackers viewed the Twenex system as yet another authoritarian symbol begging to be subverted. The system\'s name itself was a protest. Officially dubbed TOPS-20 by DEC, it was a successor to TOPS-10, a commercial operating system DEC marketed for the PDP-10. Bolt Beranek Newman had deveoped an improved version, dubbed Tenex, which TOPS-20 drew upon.Multiple sources: see Richard Stallman interview, Gerald Sussman email, and Jargon File 3.0.0. http://www.clueless.com/jargon3.0.0/TWENEX.html Stallman, the hacker who coined the Twenex term, says he came up with the name as a way to avoid using the TOPS-20 name. \"The system was far from tops, so there was no way I was going to call it that,\" Stallman recalls. \"So I decided to insert a `w\' in the Tenex name and call it Twenex.\" The machine that ran the Twenex/TOPS-20 system had its own derisive nickname: Oz. According to one hacker legend, the machine got its nickname because it required a smaller PDP-11 machine to power its terminal. One hacker, upon viewing the KL-10-PDP-11 setup for the first time, likened it to the wizard\'s bombastic onscreen introduction in the Wizard of Oz. \"I am the great and powerful Oz,\" the hacker intoned. \"Pay no attention to the PDP-11 behind that console.\"See http://www.as.cmu.edu/~geek/humor/See_Figure_1.txt If hackers laughed when they first encountered the KL-10, their laughter quickly died when they encountered Twenex. Not only did Twenex boast built-in security, but the system\'s software engineers had designed the tools and applications with the security system in mind. What once had been a cat-and-mouse game over passwords in the case of the Laboratory for Computer Science\'s security system, now became an out-and-out battle over system management. System administrators argued that without security, the Oz system was more prone to accidental crashes. Hackers argued that crashes could be better prevented by overhauling the source code. Unfortunately, the number of hackers with the time and inclination to perform this sort of overhaul had dwindled to the point that the system-administrator argument prevailed. Cadging passwords and deliberately crashing the system in order to glean evidence from the resulting wreckage, Stallman successfully foiled the system administrators\' attempt to assert control. After one foiled \"coup d\'etat,\" Stallman issued an alert to the entire AI staff. \"There has been another attempt to seize power,\" Stallman wrote. \"So far, the aristocratic forces have been defeated.\" To protect his identity, Stallman signed the message \"Radio Free OZ.\" The disguise was a thin one at best. By 1982, Stallman\'s aversion to passwords and secrecy had become so well known that users outside the AI Laboratory were using his account as a stepping stone to the ARPAnet, the research-funded computer network that would serve as a foundation for today\'s Internet. One such \"tourist\" during the early 1980s was Don Hopkins, a California programmer who learned through the hacking grapevine that all an outsider needed to do to gain access to MIT\'s vaunted ITS system was to log in under the initials RMS and enter the same three-letter monogram when the system requested a password. \"I\'m eternally grateful that MIT let me and many other people use their computers for free,\" says Hopkins. \"It meant a lot to many people.\" This so-called \"tourist\" policy, which had been openly tolerated by MIT management during the ITS years,See \"MIT AI Lab Tourist Policy.\" http://catalog.com/hopkins/text/tourist-policy.html fell by the wayside when Oz became the lab\'s primary link to the ARPAnet. At first, Stallman continued his policy of repeating his login ID as a password so outside users could follow in his footsteps. Over time, however, the Oz\'s fragility prompted administrators to bar outsiders who, through sheer accident or malicious intent, might bring down the system. When those same administrators eventually demanded that Stallman stop publishing his password, Stallman, citing personal ethics, refused to do so and ceased using the Oz system altogether.3 \"[When] passwords first appeared at the MIT AI Lab I [decided] to follow my belief that there should be no passwords,\" Stallman would later say. \"Because I don\'t believe that it\'s really desirable to have security on a computer, I shouldn\'t be willing to help uphold the security regime.\" Stallman\'s refusal to bow before the great and powerful Oz symbolized the growing tension between hackers and AI Lab management during the early 1980s. This tension paled in comparison to the conflict that raged within the hacker community itself. By the time the KL-10 arrived, the hacker community had already divided into two camps. The first centered around a software company called Symbolics, Inc. The second centered around Symbolics chief rival, Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI). Both companies were in a race to market the Lisp Machine, a device built to take full advantage of the Lisp programming language. Created by artificial-intelligence research pioneer John McCarthy, a MIT artificial-intelligence researcher during the late 1950s, Lisp is an elegant language well-suited for programs charged with heavy-duty sorting and processing. The language\'s name is a shortened version of LISt Processing. Following McCarthy\'s departure to the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT hackers refined the language into a local dialect dubbed MACLISP. The \"MAC\" stood for Project MAC, the DARPA-funded research project that gave birth to the AI Lab and the Laboratory for Computer Science. Led by AI Lab arch-hacker Richard Greenblatt, AI Lab programmers during the 1970s built up an entire Lisp-based operating system, dubbed the Lisp Machine operating system. By 1980, the Lisp Machine project had generated two commercial spin-offs. Symbolics was headed by Russell Noftsker, a former AI Lab administrator, and Lisp Machines, Inc., was headed by Greenblatt. The Lisp Machine software was hacker-built, meaning it was owned by MIT but available for anyone to copy as per hacker custom. Such a system limited the marketing advantage of any company hoping to license the software from MIT and market it as unique. To secure an advantage, and to bolster the aspects of the operating system that customers might consider attractive, the companies recruited various AI Lab hackers and set them working on various components of the Lisp Machine operating system outside the auspices of the AI Lab. The most aggressive in this strategy was Symbolics. By the end of 1980, the company had hired 14 AI Lab staffers as part-time consultants to develop its version of the Lisp Machine. Apart from Stallman, the rest signed on to help LMI.See H. P. Newquist, The Brain Makers: Genius, Ego, and Greed in the Quest for Machines that Think (Sams Publishing, 1994): 172. At first, Stallman accepted both companies\' attempt to commercialize the Lisp machine, even though it meant more work for him. Both licensed the Lisp Machine OS source code from MIT, and it was Stallman\'s job to update the lab\'s own Lisp Machine to keep pace with the latest innovations. Although Symbolics\' license with MIT gave Stallman the right to review, but not copy, Symbolics\' source code, Stallman says a \"gentleman\'s agreement\" between Symbolics management and the AI Lab made it possible to borrow attractive snippets in traditional hacker fashion. On March 16, 1982, a date Stallman remembers well because it was his birthday, Symbolics executives decided to end this gentlemen\'s agreement. The move was largely strategic. LMI, the primary competition in the Lisp Machine marketplace, was essentially using a copy of the AI Lab Lisp Machine. Rather than subsidize the development of a market rival, Symbolics executives elected to enforce the letter of the license. If the AI Lab wanted its operating system to stay current with the Symbolics operating system, the lab would have to switch over to a Symbolics machine and sever its connection to LMI. As the person responsible for keeping up the lab\'s Lisp Machine, Stallman was incensed. Viewing this announcement as an \"ultimatum,\" he retaliated by disconnecting Symbolics\' microwave communications link to the laboratory. He then vowed never to work on a Symbolics machine and pledged his immediate allegiance to LMI. \"The way I saw it, the AI Lab was a neutral country, like Belgium in World War I,\" Stallman says. \"If Germany invades Belgium, Belgium declares war on Germany and sides with Britain and France.\" The circumstances of the so-called \"Symbolics War\" of 1982-1983 depend heavily on the source doing the telling. When Symbolics executives noticed that their latest features were still appearing in the AI Lab Lisp Machine and, by extension, the LMI Lisp machine, they installed a \"spy\" program on Stallman\'s computer terminal. Stallman says he was rewriting the features from scratch, taking advantage of the license\'s review clause but also taking pains to make the source code as different as possible. Symbolics executives argued otherwise and took their case to MIT administration. According to 1994 book, The Brain Makers: Genius, Ego, and Greed, and the Quest for Machines That Think, written by Harvey Newquist, the administration responded with a warning to Stallman to \"stay away\" from the Lisp Machine project.Ibid.: 196. According to Stallman, MIT administrators backed Stallman up. \"I was never threatened,\" he says. \"I did make changes in my practices, though. Just to be ultra safe, I no longer read their source code. I used only the documentation and wrote the code from that.\" Whatever the outcome, the bickering solidified Stallman\'s resolve. With no source code to review, Stallman filled in the software gaps according to his own tastes and enlisted members of the AI Lab to provide a continuous stream of bug reports. He also made sure LMI programmers had direct access to the changes. \"I was going to punish Symbolics if it was the last thing I did,\" Stallman says. Such statements are revealing. Not only do they shed light on Stallman\'s nonpacifist nature, they also reflect the intense level of emotion triggered by the conflict. According to another Newquist-related story, Stallman became so irate at one point that he issued an email threatening to \"wrap myself in dynamite and walk into Symbolics\' offices.\"Ibid. Newquist, who says this anecdote was confirmed by several Symbolics executives, writes, \"The message caused a brief flurry of excitement and speculation on the part of Symbolics\' employees, but ultimately, no one took Stallman\'s outburst that seriously.\" Although Stallman would deny any memory of the email and still describes its existence as a \"vicious rumor,\" he acknowledges that such thoughts did enter his head. \"I definitely did have fantasies of killing myself and destroying their building in the process,\" Stallman says. \"I thought my life was over.\" The level of despair owed much to what Stallman viewed as the \"destruction\" of his \"home\"-i.e., the demise of the AI Lab\'s close-knit hacker subculture. In a later email interview with Levy, Stallman would liken himself to the historical figure Ishi, the last surviving member of the Yahi, a Pacific Northwest tribe wiped out during the Indian wars of the 1860s and 1870s. The analogy casts Stallman\'s survival in epic, almost mythical, terms. In reality, however, it glosses over the tension between Stallman and his fellow AI Lab hackers prior to the Symbolics-LMI schism. Instead of seeing Symbolics as an exterminating force, many of Stallman\'s colleagues saw it as a belated bid for relevance. In commercializing the Lisp Machine, the company pushed hacker principles of engineer-driven software design out of the ivory-tower confines of the AI Lab and into the corporate marketplace where manager-driven design principles held sway. Rather than viewing Stallman as a holdout, many hackers saw him as a troubling anachronism. Stallman does not dispute this alternate view of historical events. In fact, he says it was yet another reason for the hostility triggered by the Symbolics \"ultimatum.\" Even before Symbolics hired away most of the AI Lab\'s hacker staff, Stallman says many of the hackers who later joined Symbolics were shunning him. \"I was no longer getting invited to go to Chinatown,\" Stallman recalls. \"The custom started by Greenblatt was that if you went out to dinner, you went around or sent a message asking anybody at the lab if they also wanted to go. Sometime around 1980-1981, I stopped getting asked. They were not only not inviting me, but one person later confessed that he had been pressured to lie to me to keep their going away to dinner without me a secret.\" Although Stallman felt anger toward the hackers who orchestrated this petty form of ostracism, the Symbolics controversy dredged up a new kind of anger, the anger of a person about to lose his home. When Symbolics stopped sending over its source-code changes, Stallman responded by holing up in his MIT offices and rewriting each new software feature and tool from scratch. Frustrating as it may have been, it guaranteed that future Lisp Machine users had unfettered access to the same features as Symbolics users. It also guaranteed Stallman\'s legendary status within the hacker community. Already renowned for his work with Emacs, Stallman\'s ability to match the output of an entire team of Symbolics programmers-a team that included more than a few legendary hackers itself-still stands has one of the major human accomplishments of the Information Age, or of any age for that matter. Dubbing it a \"master hack\" and Stallman himself a \"virtual John Henry of computer code,\" author Steven Levy notes that many of his Symbolics-employed rivals had no choice but to pay their idealistic former comrade grudging respect. Levy quotes Bill Gosper, a hacker who eventually went to work for Symbolics in the company\'s Palo Alto office, expressing amazement over Stallman\'s output during this period: I can see something Stallman wrote, and I might decide it was bad (probably not, but somebody could convince me it was bad), and I would still say, \"But wait a minute-Stallman doesn\'t have anybody to argue with all night over there. He\'s working alone! It\'s incredible anyone could do this alone!\"See Steven Levy, Hackers (Penguin USA [paperback], 1984): 426. For Stallman, the months spent playing catch up with Symbolics evoke a mixture of pride and profound sadness. As a dyed-in-the-wool liberal whose father had served in World War II, Stallman is no pacifist. In many ways, the Symbolics war offered the rite of passage toward which Stallman had been careening ever since joining the AI Lab staff a decade before. At the same time, however, it coincided with the traumatic destruction of the AI Lab hacker culture that had nurtured Stallman since his teenage years. One day, while taking a break from writing code, Stallman experienced a traumatic moment passing through the lab\'s equipment room. There, Stallman encountered the hulking, unused frame of the PDP-10 machine. Startled by the dormant lights, lights that once actively blinked out a silent code indicating the status of the internal program, Stallman says the emotional impact was not unlike coming across a beloved family member\'s well-preserved corpse. \"I started crying right there in the equipment room,\" he says. \"Seeing the machine there, dead, with nobody left to fix it, it all drove home how completely my community had been destroyed.\" Stallman would have little opportunity to mourn. The Lisp Machine, despite all the furor it invoked and all the labor that had gone into making it, was merely a sideshow to the large battles in the technology marketplace. The relentless pace of computer miniaturization was bringing in newer, more powerful microprocessors that would soon incorporate the machine\'s hardware and software capabilities like a modern metropolis swallowing up an ancient desert village. Riding atop this microprocessor wave were hundreds-thousands-of commercial software programs, each protected by a patchwork of user licenses and nondisclosure agreements that made it impossible for hackers to review or share source code. The licenses were crude and ill-fitting, but by 1983 they had become strong enough to satisfy the courts and scare away would-be interlopers. Software, once a form of garnish most hardware companies gave away to make their expensive computer systems more flavorful, was quickly becoming the main dish. In their increasing hunger for new games and features, users were putting aside the traditional demand to review the recipe after every meal. Nowhere was this state of affairs more evident than in the realm of personal computer systems. Companies such as Apple Computer and Commodore were minting fresh millionaires selling machines with built-in operating systems. Unaware of the hacker culture and its distaste for binary-only software, many of these users saw little need to protest when these companies failed to attach the accompanying source-code files. A few anarchic adherents of the hacker ethic helped propel that ethic into this new marketplace, but for the most part, the marketplace rewarded the programmers speedy enough to write new programs and savvy enough to copyright them as legally protected works. One of the most notorious of these programmers was Bill Gates, a Harvard dropout two years Stallman\'s junior. Although Stallman didn\'t know it at the time, seven years before sending out his message to the n et.unix-wizards newsgroup, Gates, a budding entrepreneur and general partner with the Albuquerque-based software firm Micro-Soft, later spelled as Microsoft, had sent out his own open letter to the software-developer community. Written in response to the PC users copying Micro-Soft\'s software programs, Gates\' \" Open Letter to Hobbyists\" had excoriated the notion of communal software development. \"Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?\" asked Gates. \"What hobbyist can put three man-years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product, and distributing it for free?\"See Bill Gates, \"An Open Letter to Hobbyists\" (February 3, 1976). To view an online copy of this letter, go to http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/gateswhine.html. Although few hackers at the AI Lab saw the missive, Gates\' 1976 letter nevertheless represented the changing attitude toward software both among commercial software companies and commercial software developers. Why treat software as a zero-cost commodity when the market said otherwise? As the 1970s gave way to the 1980s, selling software became more than a way to recoup costs; it became a political statement. At a time when the Reagan Administration was rushing to dismantle many of the federal regulations and spending programs that had been built up during the half century following the Great Depression, more than a few software programmers saw the hacker ethic as anticompetitive and, by extension, un-American. At best, it was a throwback to the anticorporate attitudes of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Like a Wall Street banker discovering an old tie-dyed shirt hiding between French-cuffed shirts and double-breasted suits, many computer programmers treated the hacker ethic as an embarrassing reminder of an idealistic age. For a man who had spent the entire 1960s as an embarrassing throwback to the 1950s, Stallman didn\'t mind living out of step with his peers. As a programmer used to working with the best machines and the best software, however, Stallman faced what he could only describe as a \"stark moral choice\": either get over his ethical objection for \" proprietary\" software-the term Stallman and his fellow hackers used to describe any program that carried private copyright or end-user license that restricted copying and modification-or dedicate his life to building an alternate, nonproprietary system of software programs. Given his recent months-long ordeal with Symbolics, Stallman felt more comfortable with the latter option. \"I suppose I could have stopped working on computers altogether,\" Stallman says. \"I had no special skills, but I\'m sure I could have become a waiter. Not at a fancy restaurant, probably, but I could\'ve been a waiter somewhere.\" ');

Looking back on his life since moving to Cambridge, Stallman finds it easy to identify lengthy periods when software programming provided the only pleasure. Rather than drop out, Stallman decided to stick it out. An atheist, Stallman rejects notions such as fate, dharma, or a divine calling in life. Nevertheless, he does feel that the decision to shun proprietary software and build an operating system to help others do the same was a natural one. After all, it was Stallman\'s own personal combination of stubbornness, foresight, and coding virtuosity that led him to consider a fork in the road most others didn\'t know existed. In describing the decision in a chapter for the 1999 book, Open Sources, Stallman cites the spirit encapsulated in the words of the Jewish sage Hillel: If I am not for myself, who will be for me?If I am only for myself, what am I?If not now, when?See Richard Stallman, Open Sources (O\'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1999): 56. Stallman adds his own footnote to this statement, writing, \"As an atheist, I don\'t follow any religious leaders, but I sometimes find I admire something one of them has said.\" Speaking to audiences, Stallman avoids the religious route and expresses the decision in pragmatic terms. \"I asked myself: what could I, an operating-system developer, do to improve the situation? It wasn\'t until I examined the question for a while that I realized an operating-system developer was exactly what was needed to solve the problem.\" Once he reached that decision, Stallman says, everything else \"fell into place.\" He would abstain from using software programs that forced him to compromise his ethical beliefs, while at the same time devoting his life to the creation of software that would make it easier for others to follow the same path. Pledging to build a free software operating system \"or die trying-of old age, of course,\" Stallman quips, he resigned from the MIT staff in January, 1984, to build GNU. The resignation distanced Stallman\'s work from the legal auspices of MIT. Still, Stallman had enough friends and allies within the AI Lab to retain rent-free access to his MIT office. He also had the ability to secure outside consulting gigs to underwrite the early stages of the GNU Project. In resigning from MIT, however, Stallman negated any debate about conflict of interest or Institute ownership of the software. The man whose early adulthood fear of social isolation had driven him deeper and deeper into the AI Lab\'s embrace was now building a legal firewall between himself and that environment. For the first few months, Stallman operated in isolation from the Unix community as well. Although his announcement to the net.unix-wizards group had attracted sympathetic responses, few volunteers signed on to join the crusade in its early stages. \"The community reaction was pretty much uniform,\" recalls Rich Morin, leader of a Unix user group at the time. \"People said, `Oh, that\'s a great idea. Show us your code. Show us it can be done.\'\" In true hacker fashion, Stallman began looking for existing programs and tools that could be converted into GNU programs and tools. One of the first was a compiler named VUCK, which converted programs written in the popular C programming language into machine-readable code. Translated from the Dutch, the program\'s acronym stood for the Free University Compiler Kit. Optimistic, Stallman asked the program\'s author if the program was free. When the author informed him that the words \"Free University\" were a reference to the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, Stallman was chagrined. \"He responded derisively, stating that the university was free but the compiler was not,\" recalls Stallman. \"I therefore decided that my first program for the GNU Project would be a multi-language, multi-platform compiler.\" Eventually Stallman found a Pastel language compiler written by programmers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. According to Stallman\'s knowledge at the time, the compiler was free to copy and modify. Unfortunately, the program possessed a sizable design flaw: it saved each program into core memory, tying up precious space for other software activities. On mainframe systems this design flaw had been forgivable. On Unix systems it was a crippling barrier, since the machines that ran Unix were too small to handle the large files generated. Stallman made substantial progress at first, building a C-compatible frontend to the compiler. By summer, however, he had come to the conclusion that he would have to build a totally new compiler from scratch. In September of 1984, Stallman shelved compiler development for the near term and began searching for lower-lying fruit. He began development of a GNU version of Emacs, the program he himself had been supervising for a decade. The decision was strategic. Within the Unix community, the two native editor programs were vi, written by Sun Microsystems cofounder Bill Joy, and ed, written by Bell Labs scientist (and Unix cocreator) Ken Thompson. Both were useful and popular, but neither offered the endlessly expandable nature of Emacs. In rewriting Emacs for the Unix audience, Stallman stood a better chance of showing off his skills. It also stood to reason that Emacs users might be more attuned to the Stallman mentality. Looking back, Stallman says he didn\'t view the decision in strategic terms. \"I wanted an Emacs, and I had a good opportunity to develop one.\" Once again, the notion of reinventing the wheel grated on Stallman\'s efficient hacker sensibilities. In writing a Unix version of Emacs, Stallman was soon following the footsteps of Carnegie Mellon graduate student James Gosling, author of a C-based version dubbed Gosling Emacs or GOSMACS. Gosling\'s version of Emacs included an interpreter that exploited a simplified offshoot of the Lisp language called MOCKLISP. Determined to build GNU Emacs on a similar Lisp foundation, Stallman borrowed copiously from Gosling\'s innovations. Although Gosling had put GOSMACS under copyright and had sold the rights to UniPress, a privately held software company, Stallman cited the assurances of a fellow developer who had participated in the early MOCKLISP interpreter. According to the developer, Gosling, while a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon, had assured early collaborators that their work would remain accessible. When UniPress caught wind of Stallman\'s project, however, the company threatened to enforce the copyright. Once again, Stallman faced the prospect of building from the ground up. In the course of reverse-engineering Gosling\'s interpreter, Stallman would create a fully functional Lisp interpreter, rendering the need for Gosling\'s original interpreter moot. Nevertheless, the notion of developers selling off software rights-indeed, the very notion of developers having software rights to sell in the first place-rankled Stallman. In a 1986 speech at the Swedish Royal Technical Institute, Stallman cited the UniPress incident as yet another example of the dangers associated with proprietary software. \"Sometimes I think that perhaps one of the best things I could do with my life is find a gigantic pile of proprietary software that was a trade secret, and start handing out copies on a street corner so it wouldn\'t be a trade secret any more,\" said Stallman. \"Perhaps that would be a much more efficient way for me to give people new free software than actually writing it myself; but everyone is too cowardly to even take it.\" Despite the stress it generated, the dispute over Gosling\'s innovations would assist both Stallman and the free software movement in the long term. It would force Stallman to address the weaknesses of the Emacs Commune and the informal trust system that had allowed problematic offshoots to emerge. It would also force Stallman to sharpen the free software movement\'s political objectives. Following the release of GNU Emacs in 1985, Stallman issued \" The GNU Manifesto,\" an expansion of the original announcement posted in September, 1983. Stallman included within the document a lengthy section devoted to the many arguments used by commercial and academic programmers to justify the proliferation of proprietary software programs. One argument, \"Don\'t programmers deserve a reward for their creativity,\" earned a response encapsulating Stallman\'s anger over the recent Gosling Emacs episode: \"If anything deserves a reward, it is social contribution,\" Stallman wrote. \"Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far [sic] as society is free to use the results. If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative programs, by the same token they deserve to be punished if they restrict the use of these programs.\"See Richard Stallman, \"The GNU Manifesto\" (1985). http://www.gnu.org/manifesto.html With the release of GNU Emacs, the GNU Project finally had code to show. It also had the burdens of any software-based enterprise. As more and more Unix developers began playing with the software, money, gifts, and requests for tapes began to pour in. To address the business side of the GNU Project, Stallman drafted a few of his colleagues and formed the Free Software Foundation (FSF), a nonprofit organization dedicated to speeding the GNU Project towards its goal. With Stallman as president and various hacker allies as board members, the FSF helped provide a corporate face for the GNU Project. Robert Chassell, a programmer then working at Lisp Machines, Inc., became one of five charter board members at the Free Software Foundation following a dinner conversation with Stallman. Chassell also served as the organization\'s treasurer, a role that started small but quickly grew. \"I think in \'85 our total expenses and revenue were something in the order of $23,000, give or take,\" Chassell recalls. \"Richard had his office, and we borrowed space. I put all the stuff, especially the tapes, under my desk. It wasn\'t until sometime later LMI loaned us some space where we could store tapes and things of that sort.\" In addition to providing a face, the Free Software Foundation provided a center of gravity for other disenchanted programmers. The Unix market that had seemed so collegial even at the time of Stallman\'s initial GNU announcement was becoming increasingly competitive. In an attempt to tighten their hold on customers, companies were starting to close off access to Unix source code, a trend that only speeded the number of inquiries into ongoing GNU software projects. The Unix wizards who once regarded Stallman as a noisy kook were now beginning to see him as a software Cassandra. \"A lot of people don\'t realize, until they\'ve had it happen to them, how frustrating it can be to spend a few years working on a software program only to have it taken away,\" says Chassell, summarizing the feelings and opinions of the correspondents writing in to the FSF during the early years. \"After that happens a couple of times, you start to say to yourself, `Hey, wait a minute.\'\" For Chassell, the decision to participate in the Free Software Foundation came down to his own personal feelings of loss. Prior to LMI, Chassell had been working for hire, writing an introductory book on Unix for Cadmus, Inc., a Cambridge-area software company. When Cadmus folded, taking the rights to the book down with it, Chassell says he attempted to buy the rights back with no success. \"As far as I know, that book is still sitting on shelf somewhere, unusable, uncopyable, just taken out of the system,\" Chassell says. \"It was quite a good introduction if I may say so myself. It would have taken maybe three or four months to convert [the book] into a perfectly usable introduction to GNU/Linux today. The whole experience, aside from what I have in my memory, was lost.\" Forced to watch his work sink into the mire while his erstwhile employer struggled through bankruptcy, Chassell says he felt a hint of the anger that drove Stallman to fits of apoplexy. \"The main clarity, for me, was the sense that if you want to have a decent life, you don\'t want to have bits of it closed off,\" Chassell says. \"This whole idea of having the freedom to go in and to fix something and modify it, whatever it may be, it really makes a difference. It makes one think happily that after you\'ve lived a few years that what you\'ve done is worthwhile. Because otherwise it just gets taken away and thrown out or abandoned or, at the very least, you no longer have any relation to it. It\'s like losing a bit of your life.\" St. Ignucius The Maui High Performance Computing Center is located in a single-story building in the dusty red hills just above the town of Kihei. Framed by million-dollar views and the multimillion dollar real estate of the Silversword Golf Course, the center seems like the ultimate scientific boondoggle. Far from the boxy, sterile confines of Tech Square or even the sprawling research metropolises of Argonne, Illinois and Los Alamos, New Mexico, the MHPCC seems like the kind of place where scientists spend more time on their tans than their post-doctoral research projects. The image is only half true. Although researchers at the MHPCC do take advantage of the local recreational opportunities, they also take their work seriously. According to Top500.org, a web site that tracks the most powerful supercomputers in the world, the IBM SP Power3 supercomputer housed within the MHPCC clocks in at 837 billion floating-point operations per second, making it one of 25 most powerful computers in the world. Co-owned and operated by the University of Hawaii and the U.S. Air Force, the machine divides its computer cycles between the number crunching tasks associated with military logistics and high-temperature physics research. Simply put, the MHPCC is a unique place, a place where the brainy culture of science and engineering and the laid-back culture of the Hawaiian islands coexist in peaceful equilibrium. A slogan on the lab\'s 2000 web site sums it up: \"Computing in paradise.\" It\'s not exactly the kind of place you\'d expect to find Richard Stallman, a man who, when taking in the beautiful view of the nearby Maui Channel through the picture windows of a staffer\'s office, mutters a terse critique: \"Too much sun.\" Still, as an emissary from one computing paradise to another, Stallman has a message to deliver, even if it means subjecting his pale hacker skin to the hazards of tropical exposure. The conference room is already full by the time I arrive to catch Stallman\'s speech. The gender breakdown is a little better than at the New York speech, 85% male, 15% female, but not by much. About half of the audience members wear khaki pants and logo-encrusted golf shirts. The other half seems to have gone native. Dressed in the gaudy flower-print shirts so popular in this corner of the world, their faces are a deep shade of ochre. The only residual indication of geek status are the gadgets: Nokia cell phones, Palm Pilots, and Sony VAIO laptops. Needless to say, Stallman, who stands in front of the room dressed in plain blue T-shirt, brown polyester slacks, and white socks, sticks out like a sore thumb. The fluorescent lights of the conference room help bring out the unhealthy color of his sun-starved skin. His beard and hair are enough to trigger beads of sweat on even the coolest Hawaiian neck. Short of having the words \"mainlander\" tattooed on his forehead, Stallman couldn\'t look more alien if he tried. As Stallman putters around the front of the room, a few audience members wearing T-shirts with the logo of the Maui FreeBSD Users Group (MFUG) race to set up camera and audio equipment. FreeBSD, a free software offshoot of the Berkeley Software Distribution, the venerable 1970s academic version of Unix, is technically a competitor to the GNU/Linux operating system. Still, in the hacking world, Stallman speeches are documented with a fervor reminiscent of the Grateful Dead and its legendary army of amateur archivists. As the local free software heads, it\'s up to the MFUG members to make sure fellow programmers in Hamburg, Mumbai, and Novosibirsk don\'t miss out on the latest pearls of RMS wisdom. The analogy to the Grateful Dead is apt. Often, when describing the business opportunities inherent within the free software model, Stallman has held up the Grateful Dead as an example. In refusing to restrict fans\' ability to record live concerts, the Grateful Dead became more than a rock group. They became the center of a tribal community dedicated to Grateful Dead music. Over time, that tribal community became so large and so devoted that the band shunned record contracts and supported itself solely through musical tours and live appearances. In 1994, the band\'s last year as a touring act, the Grateful Dead drew $52 million in gate receipts alone.See \"Grateful Dead Time Capsule: 1985-1995 North American Tour Grosses.\" http://www.accessplace.com/gdtc/1197.htm While few software companies have been able to match that success, the tribal aspect of the free software community is one reason many in the latter half of the 1990s started to accept the notion that publishing software source code might be a good thing. Hoping to build their own loyal followings, companies such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett Packard have come to accept the letter, if not the spirit, of the Stallman free software message. Describing the GPL as the information-technology industry\'s \"Magna Carta,\" ZDNet software columnist Evan Leibovitch sees the growing affection for all things GNU as more than just a trend. \"This societal shift is letting users take back control of their futures,\" Leibovitch writes. \"Just as the Magna Carta gave rights to British subjects, the GPL enforces consumer rights and freedoms on behalf of the users of computer software.\"See Evan Leibovitch, \"Who\'s Afraid of Big Bad Wolves,\" ZDNet Tech Update (December 15, 2000). http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0Y/A The tribal aspect of the free software community also helps explain why 40-odd programmers, who might otherwise be working on physics projects or surfing the Web for windsurfing buoy reports, have packed into a conference room to hear Stallman speak. Unlike the New York speech, Stallman gets no introduction. He also offers no self-introduction. When the FreeBSD people finally get their equipment up and running, Stallman simply steps forward, starts speaking, and steamrolls over every other voice in the room. \"Most of the time when people consider the question of what rules society should have for using software, the people considering it are from software companies, and they consider the question from a self-serving perspective,\" says Stallman, opening his speech. \"What rules can we impose on everybody else so they have to pay us lots of money? I had the good fortune in the 1970s to be part of a community of programmers who shared software. And because of this I always like to look at the same issue from a different direction to ask: what kind of rules make possible a good society that is good for the people who are in it? And therefore I reach completely different answers.\" Once again, Stallman quickly segues into the parable of the Xerox laser printer, taking a moment to deliver the same dramatic finger-pointing gestures to the crowd. He also devotes a minute or two to the GNU/Linux name. \"Some people say to me, `Why make such a fuss about getting credit for this system? After all, the important thing is the job is done, not whether you get recognition for it.\' Well, this would be wise advice if it were true. But the job wasn\'t to build an operating system; the job is to spread freedom to the users of computers. And to do that we have to make it possible to do everything with computers in freedom.\"For narrative purposes, I have hesitated to go in-depth when describing Stallman\'s full definition of software \"freedom.\" The GNU Project web site lists four fundamental components: The freedom to run a program, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how a program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). The freedom to redistribute copies of a program so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). For more information, please visit \"The Free Software Definition\" at http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html. Adds Stallman, \"There\'s a lot more work to do.\" For some in the audience, this is old material. For others, it\'s a little arcane. When a member of the golf-shirt contingent starts dozing off, Stallman stops the speech and asks somebody to wake the person up. \"Somebody once said my voice was so soothing, he asked if I was some kind of healer,\" says Stallman, drawing a quick laugh from the crowd. \"I guess that probably means I can help you drift gently into a blissful, relaxing sleep. And some of you might need that. I guess I shouldn\'t object if you do. If you need to sleep, by all means do.\" The speech ends with a brief discussion of software patents, a growing issue of concern both within the software industry and within the free software community. Like Napster, software patents reflect the awkward nature of applying laws and concepts written for the physical world to the frictionless universe of information technology. The difference between protecting a program under copyright and protecting a program under software patents is subtle but significant. In the case of copyright, a software creator can restrict duplication of the source code but not duplication of the idea or functionality that the source code addresses. In other words, if a developer chooses not to use a software program under the original developer\'s terms, that second developer is still free to reverse-engineer the program-i.e., duplicate the software program\'s functionality by rewriting the source code from scratch. Such duplication of ideas is common within the commercial software industry, where companies often isolate reverse-engineering teams to head off accusations of corporate espionage or developer hanky-panky. In the jargon of modern software development, companies refer to this technique as \"clean room\" engineering. Software patents work differently. According to the U.S. Patent Office, companies and individuals may secure patents for innovative algorithms provided they submit their claims to a public review. In theory, this allows the patent-holder to trade off disclosure of their invention for a limited monopoly of a minimum of 20 years after the patent filing. In practice, the disclosure is of limited value, since the operation of the program is often self-evident. Unlike copyright, a patent gives its holder the ability to head off the independent development of software programs with the same or similar functionality. In the software industry, where 20 years can cover the entire life cycle of a marketplace, patents take on a strategic weight. Where companies such as Microsoft and Apple once battled over copyright and the \"look and feel\" of various technologies, today\'s Internet companies use patents as a way to stake out individual applications and business models, the most notorious example being Amazon.com\'s 2000 attempt to patent the company\'s \"one-click\" online shopping process. For most companies, however, software patents have become a defensive tool, with cross-licensing deals balancing one set of corporate patents against another in a tense form of corporate detente. Still, in a few notable cases of computer encryption and graphic imaging algorithms, software vendors have successfully stifled rival technologies. For Stallman, the software-patent issue dramatizes the need for eternal hacker vigilance. It also underlines the importance of stressing the political benefits of free software programs over the competitive benefits. Pointing to software patents\' ability to create sheltered regions in the marketplace, Stallman says competitive performance and price, two areas where free software operating systems such as GNU/Linux and FreeBSD already hold a distinct advantage over their proprietary counterparts, are red herrings compared to the large issues of user and developer freedom. \"It\'s not because we don\'t have the talent to make better software,\" says Stallman. \"It\'s because we don\'t have the right. Somebody has prohibited us from serving the public. So what\'s going to happen when users encounter these gaps in free software? Well, if they have been persuaded by the open source movement that these freedoms are good because they lead to more-powerful reliable software, they\'re likely to say, `You didn\'t deliver what you promised. This software\'s not more powerful. It\'s missing this feature. You lied to me.\' But if they have come to agree with the free software movement, that the freedom is important in itself, then they will say, `How dare those people stop me from having this feature and my freedom too.\' And with that kind of response, we may survive the hits that we\'re going to take as these patents explode.\" Such comments involve a hefty dose of spin, of course. Most open source advocates are equally, if not more, vociferous as Stallman when it comes to opposing software patents. Still, the underlying logic of Stallman\'s argument-that open source advocates emphasize the utilitarian advantages of free software over the political advantages-remains uncontested. Rather than stress the political significance of free software programs, open source advocates have chosen to stress the engineering integrity of the hacker development model. Citing the power of peer review, the open source argument paints programs such as GNU/Linux or FreeBSD as better built, better inspected and, by extension, more trushworthy to the average user. That\'s not to say the term \"open source\" doesn\'t have its political implications. For open source advocates, the term open source serves two purposes. First, it eliminates the confusion associated with the word \"free,\" a word many businesses interpret as meaning \"zero cost.\" Second, it allows companies to examine the free software phenomenon on a technological, rather than ethical, basis. Eric Raymond, cofounder of the Open Source Initiative and one of the leading hackers to endorse the term, effectively summed up the frustration of following Stallman down the political path in a 1999 essay, titled \" Shut Up and Show Them the Code\": RMS\'s rhetoric is very seductive to the kind of people we are. We hackers are thinkers and idealists who readily resonate with appeals to \"principle\" and \"freedom\" and \"rights.\" Even when we disagree with bits of his program, we want RMS\'s rhetorical style to work; we think it ought to work; we tend to be puzzled and disbelieving when it fails on the 95% of people who aren\'t wired like we are.4 Included among that 95%, Raymond writes, are the bulk of business managers, investors, and nonhacker computer users who, through sheer weight of numbers, tend to decide the overall direction of the commercial software marketplace. Without a way to win these people over, Raymond argues, programmers are doomed to pursue their ideology on the periphery of society: When RMS insists that we talk about \"computer users\' rights,\" he\'s issuing a dangerously attractive invitation to us to repeat old failures. It\'s one we should reject-not because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of language, applied to software, simply does not persuade anybody but us. In fact, it confuses and repels most people outside our culture.4 Watching Stallman deliver his political message in person, it is hard to see anything confusing or repellent. Stallman\'s appearance may seem off-putting, but his message is logical. When an audience member asks if, in shunning proprietary software, free software proponents lose the ability to keep up with the latest technological advancements, Stallman answers the question in terms of his own personal beliefs. \"I think that freedom is more important than mere technical advance,\" he says. \"I would always choose a less advanced free program rather than a more advanced nonfree program, because I won\'t give up my freedom for something like that. My rule is, if I can\'t share it with you, I won\'t take it.\" Such answers, however, reinforce the quasi-religious nature of the Stallman message. Like a Jew keeping kosher or a Mormon refusing to drink alcohol, Stallman paints his decision to use free software in the place of proprietary in the color of tradition and personal belief. As software evangelists go, Stallman avoids forcing those beliefs down listeners\' throats. Then again, a listener rarely leaves a Stallman speech not knowing where the true path to software righteousness lies. As if to drive home this message, Stallman punctuates his speech with an unusual ritual. Pulling a black robe out of a plastic grocery bag, Stallman puts it on. Out of a second bag, he pulls a reflective yellow computer disk and places it on his head. The crowd lets out a startled laugh. \"I am St. Ignucius of the Church of Emacs,\" says Stallman, raising his right hand in mock-blessing. \"I bless your computer, my child.\" <Graphic file:books/free_0801.png> Stallman dressed as St. Ignucius. Photo by Wouter van Oortmerssen. The laughter turns into full-blown applause after a few seconds. As audience members clap, the computer disk on Stallman\'s head catches the glare of an overhead light, eliciting a perfect halo effect. In the blink of an eye, Stallman goes from awkward haole to Russian religious icon. \" Emacs was initially a text editor,\" says Stallman, explaining the getup. \"Eventually it became a way of life for many and a religion for some. We call this religion the Church of Emacs.\" The skit is a lighthearted moment of self-pardoy, a humorous return-jab at the many people who might see Stallman\'s form of software asceticism as religious fanaticism in disguise. It is also the sound of the other shoe dropping-loudly. It\'s as if, in donning his robe and halo, Stallman is finally letting listeners of the hook, saying, \"It\'s OK to laugh. I know I\'m weird.\" Discussing the St. Ignucius persona afterward, Stallman says he first came up with it in 1996, long after the creation of Emacs but well before the emergence of the \"open source\" term and the struggle for hacker-community leadership that precipitated it. At the time, Stallman says, he wanted a way to \"poke fun at himself,\" to remind listeners that, though stubborn, Stallman was not the fanatic some made him out to be. It was only later, Stallman adds, that others seized the persona as a convenient way to play up his reputation as software ideologue, as Eric Raymond did in an 1999 interview with the linux.com web site: When I say RMS calibrates what he does, I\'m not belittling or accusing him of insincerity. I\'m saying that like all good communicators he\'s got a theatrical streak. Sometimes it\'s conscious-have you ever seen him in his St. Ignucius drag, blessing software with a disk platter on his head? Mostly it\'s unconscious; he\'s just learned the degree of irritating stimulus that works, that holds attention without (usually) freaking people out.See \"Guest Interview: Eric S. Raymond,\" Linux.com (May 18, 1999). http://www.linux.com/interviews/19990518/8/ Stallman takes issue with the Raymond analysis. \"It\'s simply my way of making fun of myself,\" he says. \"The fact that others see it as anything more than that is a reflection of their agenda, not mine.\" That said, Stallman does admit to being a ham. \"Are you kidding?\" he says at one point. \"I love being the center of attention.\" To facilitate that process, Stallman says he once enrolled in Toastmasters, an organization that helps members bolster their public-speaking skills and one Stallman recommends highly to others. He possesses a stage presence that would be the envy of most theatrical performers and feels a link to vaudevillians of years past. A few days after the Maui High Performance Computing Center speech, I allude to the 1999 LinuxWorld performace and ask Stallman if he has a Groucho Marx complex-i.e., the unwillingness to belong to any club that would have him as a member. Stallman\'s response is immediate: \"No, but I admire Groucho Marx in a lot of ways and certainly have been in some things I say inspired by him. But then I\'ve also been inspired in some ways by Harpo.\" The Groucho Marx influence is certainly evident in Stallman\'s lifelong fondness for punning. Then again, punning and wordplay are common hacker traits. Perhaps the most Groucho-like aspect of Stallman\'s personality, however, is the deadpan manner in which the puns are delivered. Most come so stealthily-without even the hint of a raised eyebrow or upturned smile-you almost have to wonder if Stallman\'s laughing at his audience more than the audience is laughing at him. Watching members of the Maui High Performance Computer Center laugh at the St. Ignucius parody, such concerns evaporate. While not exactly a standup act, Stallman certainly possesses the chops to keep a roomful of engineers in stitches. \"To be a saint in the Church of Emacs does not require celibacy, but it does require making a commitment to living a life of moral purity,\" he tells the Maui audience. \"You must exorcise the evil proprietary operating system from all your computer and then install a wholly [holy] free operating system. And then you must install only free software on top of that. If you make this commitment and live by it, then you too will be a saint in the Church of Emacs, and you too may have a halo.\" The St. Ignucius skit ends with a brief inside joke. On most Unix systems and Unix-related offshoots, the primary competitor program to Emacs is vi, a text-editing program developed by former UC Berkeley student and current Sun Microsystems chief scientist, Bill Joy. Before doffing his \"halo,\" Stallman pokes fun at the rival program. \"People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to use vi,\" he says. \"Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance. So happy hacking.\" After a brief question-and-answer session, audience members gather around Stallman. A few ask for autographs. \"I\'ll sign this,\" says Stallman, holding up one woman\'s print out of the GNU General Public License, \"but only if you promise me to use the term GNU/Linux instead of Linux and tell all your friends to do likewise.\" The comment merely confirms a private observation. Unlike other stage performers and political figures, Stallman has no \"off\" mode. Aside from the St. Ignucius character, the ideologue you see onstage is the ideologue you meet backstage. Later that evening, during a dinner conversation in which a programmer mentions his affinity for \"open source\" programs, Stallman, between bites, upbraids his tablemate: \"You mean free software. That\'s the proper way to refer to it.\" During the question-and-answer session, Stallman admits to playing the pedagogue at times. \"There are many people who say, `Well, first let\'s invite people to join the community, and then let\'s teach them about freedom.\' And that could be a reasonable strategy, but what we have is almost everybody\'s inviting people to join the community, and hardly anybody\'s teaching them about freedom once they come in.\" The result, Stallman says, is something akin to a third-world city. People move in, hoping to strike it rich or at the very least to take part in a vibrant, open culture, and yet those who hold the true power keep evolving new tricks and strategies-i.e., software patents-to keep the masses out. \"You have millions of people moving in and building shantytowns, but nobody\'s working on step two: getting them out of those shantytowns. If you think talking about software freedom is a good strategy, please join in doing step two. There are plenty working on step one. We need more people working on step two.\" Working on \"step two\" means driving home the issue that freedom, not acceptance, is the root issue of the free software movement. Those who hope to reform the proprietary software industry from the inside are on a fool\'s errand. \"Change from the inside is risky,\" Stallman stays. \"Unless you\'re working at the level of a Gorbachev, you\'re going to be neutralized.\" Hands pop up. Stallman points to a member of the golf shirt-wearing contingent. \"Without patents, how would you suggest dealing with commercial espionage?\" \"Well, those two questions have nothing to do with each other, really,\" says Stallman. \"But I mean if someone wants to steal another company\'s piece of software.\" Stallman\'s recoils as if hit by a poisonous spray. \"Wait a second,\" Stallman says. \"Steal? I\'m sorry, there\'s so much prejudice in that statement that the only thing I can say is that I reject that prejudice. Companies that develop nonfree software and other things keep lots and lots of trade secrets, and so that\'s not really likely to change. In the old days-even in the 1980s-for the most part programmers were not aware that there were even software patents and were paying no attention to them. What happened was that people published the interesting ideas, and if they were not in the free software movement, they kept secret the little details. And now they patent those broad ideas and keep secret the little details. So as far as what you\'re describing, patents really make no difference to it one way or another.\" \"But if it doesn\'t affect their publication,\" a new audience member jumps in, his voice trailing off almost as soon as he starts speaking. \"But it does,\" Stallman says. \"Their publication is telling you that this is an idea that\'s off limits to the rest of the community for 20 years. And what the hell good is that? Besides, they\'ve written it in such a hard way to read, both to obfuscate the idea and to make the patent as broad as possible, that it\'s basically useless looking at the published information to learn anything anyway. The only reason to look at patents is to see the bad news of what you can\'t do.\" The audience falls silent. The speech, which began at 3:15, is now nearing the 5:00 whistle, and most listeners are already squirming in their seats, antsy to get a jump start on the weekend. Sensing the fatigue, Stallman glances around the room and hastily shuts things down. \"So it looks like we\'re done,\" he says, following the observation with an auctioneer\'s \"going, going, gone\" to flush out any last-minute questioners. When nobody throws their hand up, Stallman signs off with a traditional exit line. \"Happy hacking,\" he says. Endnotes 1.

For narrative purposes, I have hesitated to go in-depth when describing Stallman\'s full definition of software \"freedom.\" The GNU Project web site lists four fundamental components: The freedom to run a program, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how a program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). The freedom to redistribute copies of a program so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3).

See Eric Raymond, \"Shut Up and Show Them the Code,\" online essay, (June 28, 1999). 5. See \"Guest Interview: Eric S. Raymond,\" Linux.com (May 18, 1999). http://www.linux.com/interviews/19990518/8/ The GNU General Public License By the spring of 1985, Richard Stallman had settled on the GNU Project\'s first milestone-a Lisp-based free software version of Emacs. To meet this goal, however, he faced two challenges. First, he had to rebuild Emacs in a way that made it platform independent. Second, he had to rebuild the Emacs Commune in a similar fashion. The dispute with UniPress had highlighted a flaw in the Emacs Commune social contract. Where users relied on Stallman\'s expert insight, the Commune\'s rules held. In areas where Stallman no longer held the position of alpha hacker-pre-1984 Unix systems, for example-individuals and companies were free to make their own rules. The tension between the freedom to modify and the freedom to exert authorial privilege had been building before GOSMACS. The Copyright Act of 1976 had overhauled U.S. copyright law, extending the legal protection of copyright to software programs. According to Section 102(b) of the Act, individuals and companies now possessed the ability to copyright the \"expression\" of a software program but not the \"actual processes or methods embodied in the program.\"See Hal Abelson, Mike Fischer, and Joanne Costello, \"Software and Copyright Law,\" updated version (1998). Translated, programmers and companies had the ability to treat software programs like a story or song. Other programmers could take inspiration from the work, but to make a direct copy or nonsatirical derivative, they first had to secure permission from the original creator. Although the new law guaranteed that even programs without copyright notices carried copyright protection, programmers quickly asserted their rights, attaching coypright notices to their software programs. At first, Stallman viewed these notices with alarm. Rare was the software program that didn\'t borrow source code from past programs, and yet, with a single stroke of the president\'s pen, Congress had given programmers and companies the power to assert individual authorship over communally built programs. It also injected a dose of formality into what had otherwise been an informal system. Even if hackers could demonstrate how a given program\'s source-code bloodlines stretched back years, if not decades, the resources and money that went into battling each copyright notice were beyond most hackers\' means. Simply put, disputes that had once been settled hacker-to-hacker were now settled lawyer-to-lawyer. In such a system, companies, not hackers, held the automatic advantage. Proponents of software copyright had their counter-arguments: without copyright, works might otherwise slip into the public domain. Putting a copyright notice on a work also served as a statement of quality. Programmers or companies who attached their name to the copyright attached their reputations as well. Finally, it was a contract, as well as a statement of ownership. Using copyright as a flexible form of license, an author could give away certain rights in exchange for certain forms of behavior on the part of the user. For example, an author could give away the right to suppress unauthorized copies just so long as the end user agreed not to create a commercial offshoot. It was this last argument that eventually softened Stallman\'s resistance to software copyright notices. Looking back on the years leading up to the GNU Project, Stallman says he began to sense the beneficial nature of copyright sometime around the release of Emacs 15.0, the last significant pre-GNU Project upgrade of Emacs. \"I had seen email messages with copyright notices plus simple `verbatim copying permitted\' licenses,\" Stallman recalls. \"Those definitely were [an] inspiration.\" For Emacs 15, Stallman drafted a copyright that gave users the right to make and distribute copies. It also gave users the right to make modified versions, but not the right to claim sole ownership of those modified versions, as in the case of GOSMACS. Although helpful in codifying the social contract of the Emacs Commune, the Emacs 15 license remained too \"informal\" for the purposes of the GNU Project, Stallman says. Soon after starting work on a GNU version of Emacs, Stallman began consulting with the other members of the Free Software Foundation on how to shore up the license\'s language. He also consulted with the attorneys who had helped him set up the Free Software Foundation. Mark Fischer, a Boston attorney specializing in intellectual-property law, recalls discussing the license with Stallman during this period. \"Richard had very strong views about how it should work,\" Fischer says, \"He had two principles. The first was to make the software absolutely as open as possible. The second was to encourage others to adopt the same licensing practices.\" Encouraging others to adopt the same licensing practices meant closing off the escape hatch that had allowed privately owned versions of Emacs to emerge. To close that escape hatch, Stallman and his free software colleagues came up with a solution: users would be free to modify GNU Emacs just so long as they published their modifications. In addition, the resulting \"derivative\" works would also have carry the same GNU Emacs License. The revolutionary nature of this final condition would take a while to sink in. At the time, Fischer says, he simply viewed the GNU Emacs License as a simple contract. It put a price tag on GNU Emacs\' use. Instead of money, Stallman was charging users access to their own later modifications. That said, Fischer does remember the contract terms as unique. \"I think asking other people to accept the price was, if not unique, highly unusual at that time,\" he says. The GNU Emacs License made its debut when Stallman finally released GNU Emacs in 1985. Following the release, Stallman welcomed input from the general hacker community on how to improve the license\'s language. One hacker to take up the offer was future software activist John Gilmore, then working as a consultant to Sun Microsystems. As part of his consulting work, Gilmore had ported Emacs over to SunOS, the company\'s in-house version of Unix. In the process of doing so, Gilmore had published the changes as per the demands of the GNU Emacs License. Instead of viewing the license as a liability, Gilmore saw it as clear and concise expression of the hacker ethos. \"Up until then, most licenses were very informal,\" Gilmore recalls. As an example of this informality, Gilmore cites a copyright notice for trn, a Unix utility. Written by Larry Wall, future creator of the Perl programming language, patch made it simple for Unix programmers to insert source-code fixes-\" patches\" in hacker jargon-into any large program. Recognizing the utility of this feature, Wall put the following copyright notice in the program\'s accompanying README file: Copyright (c) 1985, Larry Wall You may copy the trn kit in whole or in part as long as you don\'t try to make money off it, or pretend that you wrote it.See Trn Kit README. http://www.za.debian.org/doc/trn/trn-readme Such statements, while reflective of the hacker ethic, also reflected the difficulty of translating the loose, informal nature of that ethic into the rigid, legal language of copyright. In writing the GNU Emacs License, Stallman had done more than close up the escape hatch that permitted proprietary offshoots. He had expressed the hacker ethic in a manner understandable to both lawyer and hacker alike. It wasn\'t long, Gilmore says, before other hackers began discussing ways to \"port\" the GNU Emacs License over to their own programs. Prompted by a conversation on Usenet, Gilmore sent an email to Stallman in November, 1986, suggesting modification: You should probably remove \"EMACS\" from the license and replace it with \"SOFTWARE\" or something. Soon, we hope, Emacs will not be the biggest part of the GNU system, and the license applies to all of it.See John Gilmore, quoted from email to author. Gilmore wasn\'t the only person suggesting a more general approach. By the end of 1986, Stallman himself was at work with GNU Project\'s next major milestone, a source-code debugger, and was looking for ways to revamp the Emacs license so that it might apply to both programs. Stallman\'s solution: remove all specific references to Emacs and convert the license into a generic copyright umbrella for GNU Project software. The GNU General Public License, GPL for short, was born. In fashioning the GPL, Stallman followed the software convention of using decimal numbers to indicate prototype versions and whole numbers to indicate mature versions. Stallman published Version 1.0 of the GPL in 1989 (a project Stallman was developing in 1985), almost a full year after the release of the GNU Debugger, Stallman\'s second major foray into the realm of Unix programming. The license contained a preamble spelling out its political intentions: The General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.See Richard Stallman, et al., \"GNU General Public License: Version 1,\" (February, 1989). http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copying-1.0.html In fashioning the GPL, Stallman had been forced to make an additional adjustment to the informal tenets of the old Emacs Commune. Where he had once demanded that Commune members publish any and all changes, Stallman now demanded publication only in instances when programmers circulated their derivative versions in the same public manner as Stallman. In other words, programmers who simply modified Emacs for private use no longer needed to send the source-code changes back to Stallman. In what would become a rare compromise of free software doctrine, Stallman slashed the price tag for free software. Users could innovate without Stallman looking over their shoulders just so long as they didn\'t bar Stallman and the rest of the hacker community from future exchanges of the same program. Looking back, Stallman says the GPL compromise was fueled by his own dissatisfaction with the Big Brother aspect of the original Emacs Commune social contract. As much as he liked peering into other hackers\' systems, the knowledge that some future source-code maintainer might use that power to ill effect forced him to temper the GPL. \"It was wrong to require people to publish all changes,\" says Stallman. \"It was wrong to require them to be sent to one privileged developer. That kind of centralization and privilege for one was not consistent with a society in which all had equal rights.\" As hacks go, the GPL stands as one of Stallman\'s best. It created a system of communal ownership within the normally proprietary confines of copyright law. More importantly, it demonstrated the intellectual similarity between legal code and software code. Implicit within the GPL\'s preamble was a profound message: instead of viewing copyright law with suspicion, hackers should view it as yet another system begging to be hacked. \"The GPL developed much like any piece of free software with a large community discussing its structure, its respect or the opposite in their observation, needs for tweaking and even to compromise it mildly for greater acceptance,\" says Jerry Cohen, another attorney who helped Stallman with the creation of the license. \"The process worked very well and GPL in its several versions has gone from widespread skeptical and at times hostile response to widespread acceptance.\" In a 1986 interview with Byte magazine, Stallman summed up the GPL in colorful terms. In addition to proclaiming hacker values, Stallman said, readers should also \"see it as a form of intellectual jujitsu, using the legal system that software hoarders have set up against them.\"See David Betz and Jon Edwards, \"Richard Stallman discusses his public-domain [sic] Unix-compatible software system with BYTE editors,\" BYTE (July, 1996). (Reprinted on the GNU Project web site: http://www.gnu.org/gnu/byte-interview.html.) This interview offers an interesting, not to mention candid, glimpse at Stallman\'s political attitudes during the earliest days of the GNU Project. It is also helpful in tracing the evolution of Stallman\'s rhetoric. Describing the purpose of the GPL, Stallman says, \"I\'m trying to change the way people approach knowledge and information in general. I think that to try to own knowledge, to try to control whether people are allowed to use it, or to try to stop other people from sharing it, is sabotage.\" Contrast this with a statement to the author in August 2000: \"I urge you not to use the term `intellectual property\' in your thinking. It will lead you to misunderstand things, because that term generalizes about copyrights, patents, and trademarks. And those things are so different in their effects that it is entirely foolish to try to talk about them at once. If you hear somebody saying something about intellectual property, without quotes, then he\'s not thinking very clearly and you shouldn\'t join.\" Years later, Stallman would describe the GPL\'s creation in less hostile terms. \"I was thinking about issues that were in a sense ethical and in a sense political and in a sense legal,\" he says. \"I had to try to do what could be sustained by the legal system that we\'re in. In spirit the job was that of legislating the basis for a new society, but since I wasn\'t a government, I couldn\'t actually change any laws. I had to try to do this by building on top of the existing legal system, which had not been designed for anything like this.\" About the time Stallman was pondering the ethical, political, and legal issues associated with free software, a California hacker named Don Hopkins mailed him a manual for the 68000 microprocessor. Hopkins, a Unix hacker and fellow science-fiction buff, had borrowed the manual from Stallman a while earlier. As a display of gratitude, Hopkins decorated the return envelope with a number of stickers obtained at a local science-fiction convention. One sticker in particular caught Stallman\'s eye. It read, \"Copyleft (L), All Rights Reversed.\" Following the release of the first version of GPL, Stallman paid tribute to the sticker, nicknaming the free software license \"Copyleft.\" Over time, the nickname and its shorthand symbol, a backwards \"C,\" would become an official Free Software Foundation synonym for the GPL. The German sociologist Max Weber once proposed that all great religions are built upon the \"routinization\" or \"institutionalization\" of charisma. Every successful religion, Weber argued, converts the charisma or message of the original religious leader into a social, political, and ethical apparatus more easily translatable across cultures and time. While not religious per se, the GNU GPL certainly qualifies as an interesting example of this \"routinization\" process at work in the modern, decentralized world of software development. Since its unveiling, programmers and companies who have otherwise expressed little loyalty or allegiance to Stallman have willingly accepted the GPL bargain at face value. A few have even accepted the GPL as a preemptive protective mechanism for their own software programs. Even those who reject the GPL contract as too compulsory, still credit it as influential. One hacker falling into this latter group was Keith Bostic, a University of California employee at the time of the GPL 1.0 release. Bostic\'s department, the Computer Systems Research Group (SRG), had been involved in Unix development since the late 1970s and was responsible for many key parts of Unix, including the TCP/IP networking protocol, the cornerstone of modern Internet communications. By the late 1980s, AT&T, the original owner of the Unix brand name, began to focus on commercializing Unix and began looking to the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD, the academic version of Unix developed by Bostic and his Berkeley peers, as a key source of commercial technology. Although the Berkeley BSD source code was shared among researchers and commercial programmers with a source-code license, this commercialization presented a problem. The Berkeley code was intermixed with proprietary AT&T code. As a result, Berkeley distributions were available only to institutions that already had a Unix source license from AT&T. As AT&T raised its license fees, this arrangement, which had at first seemed innocuous, became increasingly burdensome. Hired in 1986, Bostic had taken on the personal project of porting BSD over to the Digital Equipment Corporation\'s PDP-11 computer. It was during this period, Bostic says, that he came into close interaction with Stallman during Stallman\'s occasional forays out to the west coast. \"I remember vividly arguing copyright with Stallman while he sat at borrowed workstations at CSRG,\" says Bostic. \"We\'d go to dinner afterward and continue arguing about copyright over dinner.\" The arguments eventually took hold, although not in the way Stallman would have liked. In June, 1989, Berkeley separated its networking code from the rest of the AT&T-owned operating system and distributed it under a University of California license. The contract terms were liberal. All a licensee had to do was give credit to the university in advertisements touting derivative programs.The University of California\'s \"obnoxious advertising clause\" would later prove to be a problem. Looking for a less restrictive alternative to the GPL, some hackers used the University of California, replacing \"University of California\" with the name of their own instution. The result: free software programs that borrowed from dozens of other programs would have to cite dozens of institutions in advertisements. In 1999, after a decade of lobbying on Stallman\'s part, the University of California agreed to drop this clause. In contrast to the GPL, proprietary offshoots were permissible. Only one problem hampered the license\'s rapid adoption: the BSD Networking release wasn\'t a complete operating system. People could study the code, but it could only be run in conjunction with other proprietary-licensed code. Over the next few years, Bostic and other University of California employees worked to replace the missing components and turn BSD into a complete, freely redistributable operating system. Although delayed by a legal challenge from Unix Systems Laboratories-the AT&T spin-off that retained ownership of the Unix brand name-the effort would finally bear fruit in the early 1990s. Even before then, however, many of the Berkeley utilities would make their way into Stallman\'s GNU Project. \"I think it\'s highly unlikely that we ever would have gone as strongly as we did without the GNU influence,\" says Bostic, looking back. \"It was clearly something where they were pushing hard and we liked the idea.\" By the end of the 1980s, the GPL was beginning to exert a gravitational effect on the free software community. A program didn\'t have to carry the GPL to qualify as free software-witness the case of the BSD utilities-but putting a program under the GPL sent a definite message. \"I think the very existence of the GPL inspired people to think through whether they were making free software, and how they would license it,\" says Bruce Perens, creator of Electric Fence, a popular Unix utility, and future leader of the Debian GNU/Linux development team. A few years after the release of the GPL, Perens says he decided to discard Electric Fence\'s homegrown license in favor of Stallman\'s lawyer-vetted copyright. \"It was actually pretty easy to do,\" Perens recalls. Rich Morin, the programmer who had viewed Stallman\'s initial GNU announcement with a degree of skepticism, recalls being impressed by the software that began to gather under the GPL umbrella. As the leader of a SunOS user group, one of Morin\'s primary duties during the 1980s had been to send out distribution tapes containing the best freeware or free software utilities. The job often mandated calling up original program authors to verify whether their programs were copyright protected or whether they had been consigned to the public domain. Around 1989, Morin says, he began to notice that the best software programs typically fell under the GPL license. \"As a software distributor, as soon as I saw the word GPL, I knew I was home free,\" recalls Morin. To compensate for the prior hassles that went into compiling distribution tapes to the Sun User Group, Morin had charged recipients a convenience fee. Now, with programs moving over to the GPL, Morin was suddenly getting his tapes put together in half the time, turning a tidy profit in the process. Sensing a commercial opportunity, Morin rechristened his hobby as a business: Prime Time Freeware. Such commercial exploitation was completely within the confines of the free software agenda. \"When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price,\" advised Stallman in the GPL\'s preamble. By the late 1980s, Stallman had refined it to a more simple mnemonic: \"Don\'t think free as in free beer; think free as in free speech.\" For the most part, businesses ignored Stallman\'s entreaties. Still, for a few entrepreneurs, the freedom associated with free software was the same freedom associated with free markets. Take software ownership out of the commercial equation, and you had a situation where even the smallest software company was free to compete against the IBMs and DECs of the world. One of the first entrepreneurs to grasp this concept was Michael Tiemann, a software programmer and graduate student at Stanford University. During the 1980s, Tiemann had followed the GNU Project like an aspiring jazz musician following a favorite artist. It wasn\'t until the release of the GNU C Compiler in 1987, however, that he began to grasp the full potential of free software. Dubbing GCC a \"bombshell,\" Tiemann says the program\'s own existence underlined Stallman\'s determination as a programmer. \"Just as every writer dreams of writing the great American novel, every programmer back in the 1980s talked about writing the great American compiler,\" Tiemman recalls. \"Suddenly Stallman had done it. It was very humbling.\" \"You talk about single points of failure, GCC was it,\" echoes Bostic. \"Nobody had a compiler back then, until GCC came along.\" Rather than compete with Stallman, Tiemann decided to build on top of his work. The original version of GCC weighed in at 110,000 lines of code, but Tiemann recalls the program as surprisingly easy to understand. So easy in fact that Tiemann says it took less than five days to master and another week to port the software to a new hardware platform, National Semiconductor\'s 32032 microchip. Over the next year, Tiemann began playing around with the source code, creating a native compiler for the C+ programming language. One day, while delivering a lecture on the program at Bell Labs, Tiemann ran into some AT&T developers struggling to pull off the same thing. \"There were about 40 or 50 people in the room, and I asked how many people were working on the native code compiler,\" Tiemann recalls. \"My host said the information was confidential but added that if I took a look around the room I might get a good general idea.\" It wasn\'t long after, Tiemann says, that the light bulb went off in his head. \"I had been working on that project for six months,\" Tiemann says. I just thought to myself, whether it\'s me or the code this is a level of efficiency that the free market should be ready to reward.\" Tiemann found added inspiration in the GNU Manifesto, which, while excoriating the greed of some software vendors, encourages other vendors to consider the advantages of free software from a consumer point of view. By removing the power of monopoly from the commerical software question, the GPL makes it possible for the smartest vendors to compete on the basis of service and consulting, the two most profit-rich corners of the software marketplace. In a 1999 essay, Tiemann recalls the impact of Stallman\'s Manifesto. \"It read like a socialist polemic, but I saw something different. I saw a business plan in disguise.\"7. See Michael Tiemann, \"Future of Cygnus Solutions: An Entrepreneur\'s Account,\" Open Sources (O\'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1999): 139. Teaming up with John Gilmore, another GNU Project fan, Tiemann launched a software consulting service dedicated to customizing GNU programs. Dubbed Cygnus Support, the company signed its first development contract in February, 1990. By the end of the year, the company had $725,000 worth of support and development contracts. GNU Emacs, GDB, and GCC were the \"big three\" of developer-oriented tools, but they weren\'t the only ones developed by Stallman during the GNU Project\'s first half decade. By 1990, Stallman had also generated GNU versions of the Bourne Shell (rechristened the Bourne Again Shell, or BASH), YACC (rechristened Bison), and awk (rechristened gawk). Like GCC , every GNU program had to be designed to run on multiple systems, not just a single vendor\'s platform. In the process of making programs more flexible, Stallman and his collaborators often made them more useful as well. Recalling the GNU universalist approach, Prime Time Freeware\'s Morin points to a critical, albeit mundane, software package called hello. \"It\'s the hello world program which is five lines of C, packaged up as if it were a GNU distribution,\" Morin says. \"And so it\'s got the Texinfo stuff and the configure stuff. It\'s got all the other software engineering goo that the GNU Project has come up with to allow packages to port to all these different environments smoothly. That\'s tremendously important work, and it affects not only all of [Stallman\'s] software, but also all of the other GNU Project software.\" According to Stallman, improving software programs was secondary to building them in the first place. \"With each piece I may or may not find a way to improve it,\" said Stallman to Byte. \"To some extent I am getting the benefit of reimplementation, which makes many systems much better. To some extent it\'s because I have been in the field a long time and worked on many other systems. I therefore have many ideas to bring to bear.\"See Richard Stallman, BYTE (1986). Nevertheless, as GNU tools made their mark in the late 1980s, Stallman\'s AI Lab-honed reputation for design fastidiousness soon became legendary throughout the entire software-development community. Jeremy Allison, a Sun user during the late 1980s and programmer destined to run his own free software project, Samba, in the 1990s, recalls that reputation with a laugh. During the late 1980s, Allison began using Emacs. Inspired by the program\'s community-development model, Allison says he sent in a snippet of source code only to have it rejected by Stallman. \"It was like the Onion headline,\" Allison says. \"`Child\'s prayers to God answered: No.\'\" Stallman\'s growing stature as a software programmer, however, was balanced by his struggles as a project manager. Although the GNU Project moved from success to success in creation of developer-oriented tools, its inability to generate a working kernel-the central \"traffic cop\" program in all Unix systems that determines which devices and applications get access to the microprocessor and when-was starting to elicit grumbles as the 1980s came to a close. As with most GNU Project efforts, Stallman had started kernel development by looking for an existing program to modify. According to a January 1987 \"Gnusletter,\" Stallman was already working to overhaul TRIX, a Unix kernel developed at MIT. A review of GNU Project \"GNUsletters\" of the late 1980s reflects the management tension. In January, 1987, Stallman announced to the world that the GNU Project was working to overhaul TRIX, a Unix kernel developed at MIT. A year later, in February of 1988, the GNU Project announced that it had shifted its attentions to Mach, a lightweight \"micro-kernel\" developed at Carnegie Mellon. All told, however, official GNU Project kernel development wouldn\'t commence until 1990.See \"HURD History.\" http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history.html The delays in kernel development were just one of many concerns weighing on Stallman during this period. In 1989, Lotus Development Corporation filed suit against rival software company, Paperback Software International, for copying menu commands in Lotus\' popular 1-2-3 Spreadsheet program. Lotus\' suit, coupled with the Apple -Microsoft \"look and feel\" battle, provided a troublesome backdrop for the GNU Project. Although both suits fell outside the scope of the GNU Project, both revolved around operating systems and software applications developed for the personal computer, not Unix-compatible hardware systems-they threatened to impose a chilling effect on the entire culture of software development. Determined to do something, Stallman recruited a few programmer friends and composed a magazine ad blasting the lawsuits. He then followed up the ad by helping to organize a group to protest the corporations filing the suit. Calling itself the League of Programming Freedom, the group held protests outside the offices of Lotus, Inc. and the Boston courtroom hosting the Lotus trial. The protests were notable.According to a League of Programming Freedom Press, the protests were notable for featuring the first hexadecimal protest chant: 1-2-3-4, toss the lawyers out the door; 5-6-7-8, innovate don\'t litigate; 9-A-B-C, 1-2-3 is not for me; D-E-F-O, look and feel have got to go http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Links/prep.ai.mit.edu/demo.final.release  They document the evolving nature of software industry. Applications had quietly replaced operating systems as the primary corporate battleground. In its unfulfilled quest to build a free software operating system, the GNU Project seemed hopelessly behind the times. Indeed, the very fact that Stallman had felt it necessary to put together an entirely new group dedicated to battling the \"look and feel\" lawsuits reinforced that obsolescence in the eyes of some observers. In 1990, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation cerified Stallman\'s genius status when it granted Stallman a MacArthur fellowship, therefore making him a recipient for the organization\'s so-called \"genius grant.\" The grant, a $240,000 reward for launching the GNU Project and giving voice to the free software philosophy, relieved a number of short-term concerns. First and foremost, it gave Stallman, a nonsalaried employee of the FSF who had been supporting himself through consulting contracts, the ability to devote more time to writing GNU code.I use the term \"writing\" here loosely. About the time of the MacArthur award, Stallman began suffering chronic pain in his hands and was dictating his work to FSF-employed typists. Although some have speculated that the hand pain was the result of repetitive stress injury, or RSI, an injury common among software programmers, Stallman is not 100% sure. \"It was NOT carpal tunnel syndrome,\" he writes. \"My hand problem was in the hands themselves, not in the wrists.\" Stallman has since learned to work without typists after switching to a keyboard with a lighter touch. Ironically, the award also made it possible for Stallman to vote. Months before the award, a fire in Stallman\'s apartment house had consumed his few earthly possessions. By the time of the award, Stallman was listing himself as a \"squatter\"See Reuven Lerner, \"Stallman wins $240,000 MacArthur award,\" MIT, The Tech (July 18, 1990). http://the-tech.mit.edu/V110/N30/rms.30n.html at 545 Technology Square. \"[The registrar of voters] didn\'t want to accept that as my address,\" Stallman would later recall. \"A newspaper article about the MacArthur grant said that and then they let me register.\"See Michael Gross, \"Richard Stallman: High School Misfit, Symbol of Free Software, MacArthur-certified Genius\" (1999). Most importantly, the MacArthur money gave Stallman more freedom. Already dedicated to the issue of software freedom, Stallman chose to use the additional freedom to increase his travels in support of the GNU Project mission. Interestingly, the ultimate success of the GNU Project and the free software movement in general would stem from one of these trips. In 1990, Stallman paid a visit to the Polytechnic University in Helsinki, Finland. Among the audience members was 21-year-old Linus Torvalds, future developer of the Linux kernel-the free software kernel destined to fill the GNU Project\'s most sizable gap. A student at the nearby University of Helsinki at the time, Torvalds regarded Stallman with bemusement. \"I saw, for the first time in my life, the stereotypical long-haired, bearded hacker type,\" recalls Torvalds in his 2001 autobiography Just for Fun. \"We don\'t have much of them in Helsinki.\"See Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidentaly Revolutionary (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 58-59. While not exactly attuned to the \"sociopolitical\" side of the Stallman agenda, Torvalds nevertheless appreciated the agenda\'s underlying logic: no programmer writes error-free code. By sharing software, hackers put a program\'s improvement ahead of individual motivations such as greed or ego protection. ');

(5, 1, '3823781020377999417_5768-8-4.txt.html', 5, ' The Project Gutenberg eBook of Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman\'s Crusade for Free Software, by Sam Williams Like many programmers of his generation, Torvalds had cut his teeth not on mainframe computers like the IBM 7094, but on a motley assortment of home-built computer systems. As university student, Torvalds had made the step up from C programming to Unix, using the university\'s MicroVAX. This ladder-like progression had given Torvalds a different perspective on the barriers to machine access. For Stallman, the chief barriers were bureaucracy and privilege. For Torvalds, the chief barriers were geography and the harsh Helsinki winter. Forced to trek across the University of Helsinki just to log in to his Unix account, Torvalds quickly began looking for a way to log in from the warm confines of his off-campus apartment. The search led Torvalds to the operating system Minix, a lightweight version of Unix developed for instructional purposes by Dutch university professor Andrew Tanenbaum. The program fit within the memory confines of a 386 PC, the most powerful machine Torvalds could afford, but still lacked a few necessary features. It most notably lacked terminal emulation, the feature that allowed Torvalds\' machine to mimic a university terminal, making it possible to log in to the MicroVAX from home. During the summer of 1991, Torvalds rewrote Minix from the ground up, adding other features as he did so. By the end of the summer, Torvalds was referring to his evolving work as the \"GNU/Emacs of terminal emulation programs.\"See Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidentaly Revolutionary (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 78. Feeling confident, he solicited a Minix newsgroup for copies of the POSIX standards, the software blue prints that determined whether a program was Unix compatible. A few weeks later, Torvalds was posting a message eerily reminiscent of Stallman\'s original 1983 GNU posting: Hello everybody out there using minix- I\'m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won\'t be big and professional like gnu for 386 (486) AT clones). This has been brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I\'d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).See \"Linux 10th Anniversary.\" http://www.linux10.org/history/ The posting drew a smattering of responses and within a month, Torvalds had posted a 0.01 version of the operating system-i.e., the earliest possible version fit for outside review-on an Internet FTP site. In the course of doing so, Torvalds had to come up with a name for the new system. On his own PC hard drive, Torvalds had saved the program as Linux, a name that paid its respects to the software convention of giving each Unix variant a name that ended with the letter X. Deeming the name too \"egotistical,\" Torvalds changed it to Freax, only to have the FTP site manager change it back. Although Torvalds had set out build a full operating system, both he and other developers knew at the time that most of the functional tools needed to do so were already available, thanks to the work of GNU, BSD, and other free software developers. One of the first tools the Linux development team took advantage of was the GNU C Compiler, a tool that made it possible to process programs written in the C programming language. Integrating GCC improved the performance of Linux. It also raised issues. Although the GPL\'s \"viral\" powers didn\'t apply to the Linux kernel, Torvald\'s willingness to borrow GCC for the purposes of his own free software operating system indicated a certain obligation to let other users borrow back. As Torvalds would later put it: \"I had hoisted myself up on the shoulders of giants.\"See Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidentaly Revolutionary (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 96-97. Not surprisingly, he began to think about what would happen when other people looked to him for similar support. A decade after the decision, Torvalds echoes the Free Software Foundation\'s Robert Chassel when he sums up his thoughts at the time: You put six months of your life into this thing and you want to make it available and you want to get something out of it, but you don\'t want people to take advantage of it. I wanted people to be able to see [Linux], and to make changes and improvements to their hearts\' content. But I also wanted to make sure that what I got out of it was to see what they were doing. I wanted to always have access to the sources so that if they made improvements, I could make those improvements myself.See Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidentaly Revolutionary (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 94-95. When it was time to release the 0.12 version of Linux, the first to include a fully integrated version of GCC, Torvalds decided to voice his allegiance with the free software movement. He discarded the old kernel license and replaced it with the GPL. The decision triggered a porting spree, as Torvalds and his collaborators looked to other GNU programs to fold into the growing Linux stew. Within three years, Linux developers were offering their first production release, Linux 1.0, including fully modified versions of GCC, GDB, and a host of BSD tools. By 1994, the amalgamated operating system had earned enough respect in the hacker world to make some observers wonder if Torvalds hadn\'t given away the farm by switching to the GPL in the project\'s initial months. In the first issue of Linux Journal, publisher Robert Young sat down with Torvalds for an interview. When Young asked the Finnish programmer if he felt regret at giving up private ownership of the Linux source code, Torvalds said no. \"Even with 20/20 hindsight,\" Torvalds said, he considered the GPL \"one of the very best design decisions\" made during the early stages of the Linux project.See Robert Young, \"Interview with Linus, the Author of Linux,\" Linux Journal (March 1, 1994). http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=2736 That the decision had been made with zero appeal or deference to Stallman and the Free Software Foundation speaks to the GPL\'s growing portability. Although it would take a few years to be recognized by Stallman, the explosiveness of Linux development conjured flashbacks of Emacs. This time around, however, the innovation triggering the explosion wasn\'t a software hack like Control-R but the novelty of running a Unix-like system on the PC architecture. The motives may have been different, but the end result certainly fit the ethical specifications: a fully functional operating system composed entirely of free software. As his initial email message to the comp.os.minix newsgroup indicates, it would take a few months before Torvalds saw Linux as anything less than a holdover until the GNU developers delivered on the HURD kernel. This initial unwillingness to see Linux in political terms would represent a major blow to the Free Software Foundation. As far as Torvalds was concerned, he was simply the latest in a long line of kids taking apart and reassembling things just for fun. Nevertheless, when summing up the runaway success of a project that could have just as easily spent the rest of its days on an abandoned computer hard drive, Torvalds credits his younger self for having the wisdom to give up control and accept the GPL bargain. \"I may not have seen the light,\" writes Torvalds, reflecting on Stallman\'s 1991 Polytechnic University speech and his subsequent decision to switch to the GPL. \"But I guess something from his speech sunk in .\"See Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidentaly Revolutionary (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 59. interview offers an interesting, not to mention candid, glimpse at Stallman\'s political attitudes during the earliest days of the GNU Project. It is also helpful in tracing the evolution of Stallman\'s rhetoric. Describing the purpose of the GPL, Stallman says, \"I\'m trying to change the way people approach knowledge and information in general. I think that to try to own knowledge, to try to control whether people are allowed to use it, or to try to stop other people from sharing it, is sabotage.\" Contrast this with a statement to the author in August 2000: \"I urge you not to use the term `intellectual property\' in your thinking. It will lead you to misunderstand things, because that term generalizes about copyrights, patents, and trademarks. And those things are so different in their effects that it is entirely foolish to try to talk about them at once. If you hear somebody saying something about intellectual property, without quotes, then he\'s not thinking very clearly and you shouldn\'t join.\" GNU/Linux By 1993, the free software movement was at a crossroads. To the optimistically inclined, all signs pointed toward success for the hacker cultur. Wired magazine, a funky, new publication offering stories on data encryption, Usenet, and software freedom, was flying off magazine racks. The Internet, once a slang term used only by hackers and research scientists, had found its way into mainstream lexicon. Even President Clinton was using it. The personal computer, once a hobbyist\'s toy, had grown to full-scale respectability, giving a whole new generation of computer users access to hacker-built software. And while the GNU Project had not yet reached its goal of a fully intact, free software operating system, curious users could still try Linux in the interim. Any way you sliced it, the news was good, or so it seemed. After a decade of struggle, hackers and hacker values were finally gaining acceptance in mainstream society. People were getting it. Or were they? To the pessimistically inclined, each sign of acceptance carried its own troubling countersign. Sure, being a hacker was suddenly cool, but was cool good for a community that thrived on alienation? Sure, the White House was saying all the right things about the Internet, even going so far as to register its own domain name, whitehouse.gov, but it was also meeting with the companies, censorship advocates, and law-enforcement officials looking to tame the Internet\'s Wild West culture. Sure, PCs were more powerful, but in commoditizing the PC marketplace with its chips, Intel had created a situation in which proprietary software vendors now held the power. For every new user won over to the free software cause via Linux, hundreds, perhaps thousands, were booting up Microsoft Windows for the first time. Finally, there was the curious nature of Linux itself. Unrestricted by design bugs (like GNU) and legal disputes (like BSD), Linux\' high-speed evolution had been so unplanned, its success so accidental, that programmers closest to the software code itself didn\'t know what to make of it. More compilation album than operating system, it was comprised of a hacker medley of greatest hits: everything from GCC, GDB, and glibc (the GNU Project\'s newly developed C Library) to X (a Unix-based graphic user interface developed by MIT\'s Laboratory for Computer Science) to BSD-developed tools such as BIND (the Berkeley Internet Naming Daemon, which lets users substitute easy-to-remember Internet domain names for numeric IP addresses) and TCP/IP. The arch\'s capstone, of course, was the Linux kernel-itself a bored-out, super-charged version of Minix. Rather than building their operating system from scratch, Torvalds and his rapidly expanding Linux development team had followed the old Picasso adage, \"good artists borrow; great artists steal.\" Or as Torvalds himself would later translate it when describing the secret of his success: \"I\'m basically a very lazy person who likes to take credit for things other people actually do.\"Torvalds has offered this quote in many different settings. To date, however, the quote\'s most notable appearance is in the Eric Raymond essay, \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" (May, 1997). http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html Such laziness, while admirable from an efficiency perspective, was troubling from a political perspective. For one thing, it underlined the lack of an ideological agenda on Torvalds\' part. Unlike the GNU developers, Torvalds hadn\'t built an operating system out of a desire to give his fellow hackers something to work with; he\'d built it to have something he himself could play with. Like Tom Sawyer whitewashing a fence, Torvalds\' genius lay less in the overall vision and more in his ability to recruit other hackers to speed the process. That Torvalds and his recruits had succeeded where others had not raised its own troubling question: what, exactly, was Linux? Was it a manifestation of the free software philosophy first articulated by Stallman in the GNU Manifesto? Or was it simply an amalgamation of nifty software tools that any user, similarly motivated, could assemble on his own home system? By late 1993, a growing number of Linux users had begun to lean toward the latter definition and began brewing private variations on the Linux theme. They even became bold enough to bottle and sell their variations-or \"distributions\"-to fellow Unix aficionados. The results were spotty at best. \"This was back before Red Hat and the other commercial distributions,\" remembers Ian Murdock, then a computer science student at Purdue University. \"You\'d flip through Unix magazines and find all these business card-sized ads proclaiming `Linux.\' Most of the companies were fly-by-night operations that saw nothing wrong with slipping a little of their own source code into the mix.\" Murdock, a Unix programmer, remembers being \"swept away\" by Linux when he first downloaded and installed it on his home PC system. \"It was just a lot of fun,\" he says. \"It made me want to get involved.\" The explosion of poorly built distributions began to dampen his early enthusiasm, however. Deciding that the best way to get involved was to build a version of Linux free of additives, Murdock set about putting a list of the best free software tools available with the intention of folding them into his own distribution. \"I wanted something that would live up to the Linux name,\" Murdock says. In a bid to \"stir up some interest,\" Murdock posted his intentions on the Internet, including Usenet\'s comp.os.linux newsgroup. One of the first responding email messages was from rms@ai.mit.edu . As a hacker, Murdock instantly recognized the address. It was Richard M. Stallman, founder of the GNU Project and a man Murdock knew even back then as \"the hacker of hackers.\" Seeing the address in his mail queue, Murdock was puzzled. Why on Earth would Stallman, a person leading his own operating-system project, care about Murdock\'s gripes over Linux? Murdock opened the message. \"He said the Free Software Foundation was starting to look closely at Linux and that the FSF was interested in possibly doing a Linux system, too. Basically, it looked to Stallman like our goals were in line with their philosophy.\" The message represented a dramatic about-face on Stallman\'s part. Until 1993, Stallman had been content to keep his nose out of the Linux community\'s affairs. In fact, he had all but shunned the renegade operating system when it first appeared on the Unix programming landscape in 1991. After receiving the first notification of a Unix-like operating system that ran on PCs, Stallman says he delegated the task of examining the new operating system to a friend. Recalls Stallman, \"He reported back that the software was modeled after System V, which was the inferior version of Unix. He also told me it wasn\'t portable.\" The friend\'s report was correct. Built to run on 386-based machines, Linux was firmly rooted to its low-cost hardware platform. What the friend failed to report, however, was the sizable advantage Linux enjoyed as the only freely modifiable operating system in the marketplace. In other words, while Stallman spent the next three years listening to bug reports from his HURD team, Torvalds was winning over the programmers who would later uproot and replant the operating system onto new platforms. By 1993, the GNU Project\'s inability to deliver a working kernel was leading to problems both within the GNU Project and within the free software movement at large. A March, 1993, a Wired magazine article by Simson Garfinkel described the GNU Project as \"bogged down\" despite the success of the project\'s many tools.See Simson Garfinkel, \"Is Stallman Stalled?\" Wired (March, 1993). Those within the project and its nonprofit adjunct, the Free Software Foundation, remember the mood as being even worse than Garfinkel\'s article let on. \"It was very clear, at least to me at the time, that there was a window of opportunity to introduce a new operating system,\" says Chassell. \"And once that window was closed, people would become less interested. Which is in fact exactly what happened.\"Chassel\'s concern about there being a 36-month \"window\" for a new operating system is not unique to the GNU Project. During the early 1990s, free software versions of the Berkeley Software Distribution were held up by Unix System Laboratories\' lawsuit restricting the release of BSD-derived software. While many users consider BSD offshoots such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD to be demonstrably superior to GNU/Linux both in terms of performance and security, the number of FreeBSD and OpenBSD users remains a fraction of the total GNU/Linux user population. To view a sample analysis of the relative success of GNU/Linux in relation to other free software operating systems, see the essay by New Zealand hacker, Liam Greenwood, \"Why is Linux Successful\" (1999). Much has been made about the GNU Project\'s struggles during the 1990-1993 period. While some place the blame on Stallman for those struggles, Eric Raymond, an early member of the GNU Emacs team and later Stallman critic, says the problem was largely institutional. \"The FSF got arrogant,\" Raymond says. \"They moved away from the goal of doing a production-ready operating system to doing operating-system research.\" Even worse, \"They thought nothing outside the FSF could affect them.\" Murdock, a person less privy to the inner dealings of the GNU Project, adopts a more charitable view. \"I think part of the problem is they were a little too ambitious and they threw good money after bad,\" he says. \"Micro-kernels in the late 80s and early 90s were a hot topic. Unfortunately, that was about the time that the GNU Project started to design their kernel. They ended up with alot of baggage and it would have taken a lot of backpedaling to lose it.\" Stallman cites a number of issues when explaining the delay. The Lotus and Apple lawsuits had provided political distractions, which, coupled with Stallman\'s inability to type, made it difficult for Stallman to lend a helping hand to the HURD team. Stallman also cites poor communication between various portions of the GNU Project. \"We had to do a lot of work to get the debugging environment to work,\" he recalls. \"And the people maintaining GDB at the time were not that cooperative.\" Mostly, however, Stallman says he and the other members of the GNU Project team underestimated the difficulty of expanding the Mach microkernal into a full-fledged Unix kernel. \"I figured, OK, the [Mach] part that has to talk to the machine has already been debugged,\" Stallman says, recalling the HURD team\'s troubles in a 2000 speech. \"With that head start, we should be able to get it done faster. But instead, it turned out that debugging these asynchronous multithreaded programs was really hard. There were timing books that would clobber the files, and that\'s no fun. The end result was that it took many, many years to produce a test version.\"See Maui High Performance Computing Center Speech. Whatever the excuse, or excuses, the concurrent success of the Linux-kernel team created a tense situation. Sure, the Linux kernel had been licensed under the GPL, but as Murdock himself had noted, the desire to treat Linux as a purely free software operating system was far from uniform. By late 1993, the total Linux user population had grown from a dozen or so Minix enthusiasts to somewhere between 20,000 and 100,000.GNU/Linux user-population numbers are sketchy at best, which is why I\'ve provided such a broad range. The 100,000 total comes from the Red Hat \"Milestones\" site, http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/milestones.html. What had once been a hobby was now a marketplace ripe for exploitation. Like Winston Churchill watching Soviet troops sweep into Berlin, Stallman felt an understandable set of mixed emotions when it came time to celebrate the Linux \"victory.\"I wrote this Winston Churchill analogy before Stallman himself sent me his own unsolicited comment on Churchill: World War II and the determination needed to win it was a very strong memory as I was growing up. Statements such as Churchill\'s, \"We will fight them in the landing zones, we will fight them on the beaches . . . we will never surrender,\" have always resonated for me. Although late to the party, Stallman still had clout. As soon as the FSF announced that it would lend its money and moral support to Murdock\'s software project, other offers of support began rolling in. Murdock dubbed the new project Debian-a compression of his and his wife, Deborah\'s, names-and within a few weeks was rolling out the first distribution. \"[Richard\'s support] catapulted Debian almost overnight from this interesting little project to something people within the community had to pay attention to,\" Murdock says. In January of 1994, Murdock issued the \" Debian Manifesto.\" Written in the spirit of Stallman\'s \"GNU Manifesto\" from a decade before, it explained the importance of working closely with the Free Software Foundation. Murdock wrote: The Free Software Foundation plays an extremely important role in the future of Debian. By the simple fact that they will be distributing it, a message is sent to the world that Linux is not a commercial product and that it never should be, but that this does not mean that Linux will never be able to compete commercially. For those of you who disagree, I challenge you to rationalize the success of GNU Emacs and GCC, which are not commercial software but which have had quite an impact on the commercial market regardless of that fact. The time has come to concentrate on the future of Linux rather than on the destructive goal of enriching oneself at the expense of the entire Linux community and its future. The development and distribution of Debian may not be the answer to the problems that I have outlined in the Manifesto, but I hope that it will at least attract enough attention to these problems to allow them to be solved. Shortly after the Manifesto\'s release, the Free Software Foundation made its first major request. Stallman wanted Murdock to call its distribution \"GNU/Linux.\" At first, Murdock says, Stallman had wanted to use the term \" Lignux\"-\"as in Linux with GNU at the heart of it\"-but a sample testing of the term on Usenet and in various impromptu hacker focus groups had merited enough catcalls to convince Stallman to go with the less awkward GNU/Linux. Although some would dismiss Stallman\'s attempt to add the \"GNU\" prefix as a belated quest for credit, Murdock saw it differently. Looking back, Murdock saw it as an attempt to counteract the growing tension between GNU Project and Linux-kernel developers. \"There was a split emerging,\" Murdock recalls. \"Richard was concerned.\" The deepest split, Murdock says, was over glibc. Short for GNU C Library, glibc is the package that lets programmers make \"system calls\" directed at the kernel. Over the course of 1993-1994, glibc emerged as a troublesome bottleneck in Linux development. Because so many new users were adding new functions to the Linux kernel, the GNU Project\'s glibc maintainers were soon overwhelmed with suggested changes. Frustrated by delays and the GNU Project\'s growing reputation for foot-dragging, some Linux developers suggested creating a \" fork\"-i.e., a Linux-specific C Library parallel to glibc. In the hacker world, forks are an interesting phenomenon. Although the hacker ethic permits a programmer to do anything he wants with a given program\'s source code, most hackers prefer to pour their innovations into a central source-code file or \" tree\" to ensure compatibility with other people\'s programs. To fork glibc this early in the development of Linux would have meant losing the potential input of hundreds, even thousands, of Linux developers. It would also mean growing incompatibility between Linux and the GNU system that Stallman and the GNU team still hoped to develop. As leader of the GNU Project, Stallman had already experienced the negative effects of a software fork in 1991. A group of Emacs developers working for a software company named Lucid had a falling out over Stallman\'s unwillingness to fold changes back into the GNU Emacs code base. The fork had given birth to a parallel version, Lucid Emacs, and hard feelings all around.Jamie Zawinski, a former Lucid programmer who would go on to head the Mozilla development team, has a web site that documents the Lucid/GNU Emacs fork, titled, \"The Lemacs/FSFmacs Schism.\" http://www.jwz.org/doc/lemacs.html Murdock says Debian was mounting work on a similar fork in glibc source code that motivated Stallman to insist on adding the GNU prefix when Debian rolled out its software distribution. \"The fork has since converged. Still, at the time, there was a concern that if the Linux community saw itself as a different thing as the GNU community, it might be a force for disunity.\" Stallman seconds Murdock\'s recollection. In fact, he says there were nascent forks appearing in relation to every major GNU component. At first, Stallman says he considered the forks to be a product of sour grapes. In contrast to the fast and informal dynamics of the Linux-kernel team, GNU source-code maintainers tended to be slower and more circumspect in making changes that might affect a program\'s long-term viability. They also were unafraid of harshly critiquing other people\'s code. Over time, however, Stallman began to sense that there was an underlying lack of awareness of the GNU Project and its objectives when reading Linux developers\' emails. \"We discovered that the people who considered themselves Linux users didn\'t care about the GNU Project,\" Stallman says. \"They said, `Why should I bother doing these things? I don\'t care about the GNU Project. It\'s working for me. It\'s working for us Linux users, and nothing else matters to us.\' And that was quite surprising given that people were essentially using a variant of the GNU system, and they cared so little. They cared less than anybody else about GNU.\" While some viewed descriptions of Linux as a \"variant\" of the GNU Project as politically grasping, Murdock, already sympathetic to the free software cause, saw Stallman\'s request to call Debian\'s version GNU/Linux as reasonable. \"It was more for unity than for credit,\" he says. Requests of a more technical nature quickly followed. Although Murdock had been accommodating on political issues, he struck a firmer pose when it came to the design and development model of the actual software. What had begun as a show of solidarity soon became of model of other GNU projects. \"I can tell you that I\'ve had my share of disagreements with him,\" says Murdock with a laugh. \"In all honesty Richard can be a fairly difficult person to work with.\" In 1996, Murdock, following his graduation from Purdue, decided to hand over the reins of the growing Debian project. He had already been ceding management duties to Bruce Perens, the hacker best known for his work on Electric Fence, a Unix utility released under the GPL. Perens, like Murdock, was a Unix programmer who had become enamored of GNU/Linux as soon as the program\'s Unix-like abilities became manifest. Like Murdock, Perens sympathized with the political agenda of Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, albeit from afar. \"I remember after Stallman had already come out with the GNU Manifesto, GNU Emacs, and GCC, I read an article that said he was working as a consultant for Intel,\" says Perens, recalling his first brush with Stallman in the late 1980s. \"I wrote him asking how he could be advocating free software on the one hand and working for Intel on the other. He wrote back saying, `I work as a consultant to produce free software.\' He was perfectly polite about it, and I thought his answer made perfect sense.\" As a prominent Debian developer, however, Perens regarded Murdock\'s design battles with Stallman with dismay. Upon assuming leadership of the development team, Perens says he made the command decision to distance Debian from the Free Software Foundation. \"I decided we did not want Richard\'s style of micro-management,\" he says. According to Perens, Stallman was taken aback by the decision but had the wisdom to roll with it. \"He gave it some time to cool off and sent a message that we really needed a relationship. He requested that we call it GNU/Linux and left it at that. I decided that was fine. I made the decision unilaterally. Everybody breathed a sigh of relief.\" Over time, Debian would develop a reputation as the hacker\'s version of Linux, alongside Slackware, another popular distribution founded during the same 1993-1994 period. Outside the realm of hacker-oriented systems, however, Linux was picking up steam in the commercial Unix marketplace. In North Carolina, a Unix company billing itself as Red Hat was revamping its business to focus on Linux. The chief executive officer was Robert Young, the former Linux Journal editor who in 1994 had put the question to Linus Torvalds, asking whether he had any regrets about putting the kernel under the GPL. To Young, Torvalds\' response had a \"profound\" impact on his own view toward Linux. Instead of looking for a way to corner the GNU/Linux market via traditional software tactics, Young began to consider what might happen if a company adopted the same approach as Debian-i.e., building an operating system completely out of free software parts. Cygnus Solutions, the company founded by Michael Tiemann and John Gilmore in 1990, was already demonstrating the ability to sell free software based on quality and customizability. What if Red Hat took the same approach with GNU/Linux? \"In the western scientific tradition we stand on the shoulders of giants,\" says Young, echoing both Torvalds and Sir Isaac Newton before him. \"In business, this translates to not having to reinvent wheels as we go along. The beauty of [the GPL] model is you put your code into the public domain.Young uses the term \"public domain\" incorrectly here. Public domain means not protected by copyright. GPL-protected programs are by definition protected by copyright. If you\'re an independent software vendor and you\'re trying to build some application and you need a modem-dialer, well, why reinvent modem dialers? You can just steal PPP off of Red Hat Linux and use that as the core of your modem-dialing tool. If you need a graphic tool set, you don\'t have to write your own graphic library. Just download GTK. Suddenly you have the ability to reuse the best of what went before. And suddenly your focus as an application vendor is less on software management and more on writing the applications specific to your customer\'s needs.\" Young wasn\'t the only software executive intrigued by the business efficiencies of free software. By late 1996, most Unix companies were starting to wake up and smell the brewing source code. The Linux sector was still a good year or two away from full commercial breakout mode, but those close enough to the hacker community could feel it: something big was happening. The Intel 386 chip, the Internet, and the World Wide Web had hit the marketplace like a set of monster waves, and Linux-and the host of software programs that echoed it in terms of source-code accessibility and permissive licensing-seemed like the largest wave yet. For Ian Murdock, the programmer courted by Stallman and then later turned off by Stallman\'s micromanagement style, the wave seemed both a fitting tribute and a fitting punishment for the man who had spent so much time giving the free software movement an identity. Like many Linux aficionados, Murdock had seen the original postings. He\'d seen Torvalds\'s original admonition that Linux was \"just a hobby.\" He\'d also seen Torvalds\'s admission to Minix creator Andrew Tanenbaum: \"If the GNU kernel had been ready last spring, I\'d not have bothered to even start my project.\"This quote is taken from the much-publicized Torvalds-Tanenbaum \"flame war\" following the initial release of Linux. In the process of defending his choice of a nonportable monolithic kernel design, Torvalds says he started working on Linux as a way to learn more about his new 386 PC. \"If the GNU kernel had been ready last spring, I\'d not have bothered to even start my project.\" See Chris DiBona et al., Open Sources (O\'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1999): 224. Like many, Murdock knew the opportunities that had been squandered. He also knew the excitement of watching new opportunities come seeping out of the very fabric of the Internet. \"Being involved with Linux in those early days was fun,\" recalls Murdock. \"At the same time, it was something to do, something to pass the time. If you go back and read those old [comp.os.minix] exchanges, you\'ll see the sentiment: this is something we can play with until the HURD is ready. People were anxious. It\'s funny, but in a lot of ways, I suspect that Linux would never have happened if the HURD had come along more quickly.\" By the end of 1996, however, such \"what if\" questions were already moot. Call it Linux, call it GNU/Linux; the users had spoken. The 36-month window had closed, meaning that even if the GNU Project had rolled out its HURD kernel, chances were slim anybody outside the hard-core hacker community would have noticed. The first Unix-like free software operating system was here, and it had momentum. All hackers had left to do was sit back and wait for the next major wave to come crashing down on their heads. Even the shaggy-haired head of one Richard M. Stallman. Ready or not. Open Source In November , 1995, Peter Salus, a member of the Free Software Foundation and author of the 1994 book, A Quarter Century of Unix , issued a call for papers to members of the GNU Project\'s \"system-discuss\" mailing list. Salus, the conference\'s scheduled chairman, wanted to tip off fellow hackers about the upcoming Conference on Freely Redistributable Software in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Slated for February, 1996 and sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, the event promised to be the first engineering conference solely dedicated to free software and, in a show of unity with other free software programmers, welcomed papers on \"any aspect of GNU, Linux, NetBSD, 386BSD, FreeBSD, Perl, Tcl/tk, and other tools for which the code is accessible and redistributable.\" Salus wrote: Over the past 15 years, free and low-cost software has become ubiquitous. This conference will bring together implementers of several different types of freely redistributable software and publishers of such software (on various media). There will be tutorials and refereed papers, as well as keynotes by Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman.See Peter Salus, \"FYI-Conference on Freely Redistributable Software, 2/2, Cambridge\" (1995) (archived by Terry Winograd). http://hci.stanford.edu/pcd-archives/pcd-fyi/1995/0078.html  One of the first people to receive Salus\' email was conference committee member Eric S. Raymond. Although not the leader of a project or company like the various other members of the list, Raymond had built a tidy reputation within the hacker community as a major contributor to GNU Emacs and as editor of The New Hacker Dictionary, a book version of the hacking community\'s decade-old Jargon File. For Raymond, the 1996 conference was a welcome event. Active in the GNU Project during the 1980s, Raymond had distanced himself from the project in 1992, citing, like many others before him, Stallman\'s \"micro-management\" style. \"Richard kicked up a fuss about my making unauthorized modifications when I was cleaning up the Emacs LISP libraries,\" Raymond recalls. \"It frustrated me so much that I decided I didn\'t want to work with him anymore.\" Despite the falling out, Raymond remained active in the free software community. So much so that when Salus suggested a conference pairing Stallman and Torvalds as keynote speakers, Raymond eagerly seconded the idea. With Stallman representing the older, wiser contingent of ITS/Unix hackers and Torvalds representing the younger, more energetic crop of Linux hackers, the pairing indicated a symbolic show of unity that could only be beneficial, especially to ambitious younger (i.e., below 40) hackers such as Raymond. \"I sort of had a foot in both camps,\" Raymond says. By the time of the conference, the tension between those two camps had become palpable. Both groups had one thing in common, though: the conference was their first chance to meet the Finnish wunderkind in the flesh. Surprisingly, Torvalds proved himself to be a charming, affable speaker. Possessing only a slight Swedish accent, Torvalds surprised audience members with his quick, self-effacing wit.Although Linus Torvalds is Finnish, his mother tongue is Swedish. \"The Rampantly Unofficial Linus FAQ\" offers a brief explanation: Finland has a significant (about 6%) Swedish-speaking minority population. They call themselves \"finlandssvensk\" or \"finlandssvenskar\" and consider themselves Finns; many of their families have lived in Finland for centuries. Swedish is one of Finland\'s two official languages. http://tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/linus/ Even more surprising, says Raymond, was Torvalds\' equal willingness to take potshots at other prominent hackers, including the most prominent hacker of all, Richard Stallman. By the end of the conference, Torvalds\' half-hacker, half-slacker manner was winning over older and younger conference-goers alike. \"It was a pivotal moment,\" recalls Raymond. \"Before 1996, Richard was the only credible claimant to being the ideological leader of the entire culture. People who dissented didn\'t do so in public. The person who broke that taboo was Torvalds.\" The ultimate breach of taboo would come near the end of the show. During a discussion on the growing market dominance of Microsoft Windows or some similar topic, Torvalds admitted to being a fan of Microsoft\'s PowerPoint slideshow software program. From the perspective of old-line software purists, it was like a Mormon bragging in church about his fondness of whiskey. From the perspective of Torvalds and his growing band of followers, it was simply common sense. Why shun worthy proprietary software programs just to make a point? Being a hacker wasn\'t about suffering, it was about getting the job done. \"That was a pretty shocking thing to say,\" Raymond remembers. \"Then again, he was able to do that, because by 1995 and 1996, he was rapidly acquiring clout.\" Stallman, for his part, doesn\'t remember any tension at the 1996 conference, but he does remember later feeling the sting of Torvalds\' celebrated cheekiness. \"There was a thing in the Linux documentation which says print out the GNU coding standards and then tear them up,\" says Stallman, recalling one example. \"OK, so he disagrees with some of our conventions. That\'s fine, but he picked a singularly nasty way of saying so. He could have just said `Here\'s the way I think you should indent your code.\' Fine. There should be no hostility there.\" For Raymond, the warm reception other hackers gave to Torvalds\' comments merely confirmed his suspicions. The dividing line separating Linux developers from GNU/Linux developers was largely generational. Many Linux hackers, like Torvalds, had grown up in a world of proprietary software. Unless a program was clearly inferior, most saw little reason to rail against a program on licensing issues alone. Somewhere in the universe of free software systems lurked a program that hackers might someday turn into a free software alternative to PowerPoint. Until then, why begrudge Microsoft the initiative of developing the program and reserving the rights to it? As a former GNU Project member, Raymond sensed an added dynamic to the tension between Stallman and Torvalds. In the decade since launching the GNU Project, Stallman had built up a fearsome reputation as a programmer. He had also built up a reputation for intransigence both in terms of software design and people management. Shortly before the 1996 conference, the Free Software Foundation would experience a full-scale staff defection, blamed in large part on Stallman. Brian Youmans, a current FSF staffer hired by Salus in the wake of the resignations, recalls the scene: \"At one point, Peter [Salus] was the only staff member working in the office.\" For Raymond, the defection merely confirmed a growing suspicion: recent delays such as the HURD and recent troubles such as the Lucid-Emacs schism reflected problems normally associated with software project management, not software code development. Shortly after the Freely Redistributable Software Conference, Raymond began working on his own pet software project, a popmail utility called \" fetchmail.\" Taking a cue from Torvalds, Raymond issued his program with a tacked-on promise to update the source code as early and as often as possible. When users began sending in bug reports and feature suggestions, Raymond, at first anticipating a tangled mess, found the resulting software surprisingly sturdy. Analyzing the success of the Torvalds approach, Raymond issued a quick analysis: using the Internet as his \"petri dish\" and the harsh scrutiny of the hacker community as a form of natural selection, Torvalds had created an evolutionary model free of central planning. What\'s more, Raymond decided, Torvalds had found a way around Brooks\' Law. First articulated by Fred P. Brooks, manager of IBM\'s OS/360 project and author of the 1975 book, The Mythical Man-Month , Brooks\' Law held that adding developers to a project only resulted in further project delays. Believing as most hackers that software, like soup, benefits from a limited number of cooks, Raymond sensed something revolutionary at work. In inviting more and more cooks into the kitchen, Torvalds had actually found away to make the resulting software better.Brooks\' Law is the shorthand summary of the following quote taken from Brooks\' book: Since software construction is inherently a systems effort-an exercise in complex interrelationships-communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens, not shortens, the schedule. See Fred P. Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month (Addison Wesley Publishing, 1995) Raymond put his observations on paper. He crafted them into a speech, which he promptly delivered before a group of friends and neighbors in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Dubbed \" The Cathedral and the Bazaar,\" the speech contrasted the management styles of the GNU Project with the management style of Torvalds and the kernel hackers. Raymond says the response was enthusiastic, but not nearly as enthusiastic as the one he received during the 1997 Linux Kongress, a gathering of Linux users in Germany the next spring. \"At the Kongress, they gave me a standing ovation at the end of the speech,\" Raymond recalls. \"I took that as significant for two reasons. For one thing, it meant they were excited by what they were hearing. For another thing, it meant they were excited even after hearing the speech delivered through a language barrier.\" Eventually, Raymond would convert the speech into a paper, also titled \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar.\" The paper drew its name from Raymond\'s central analogy. GNU programs were \"cathedrals,\" impressive, centrally planned monuments to the hacker ethic, built to stand the test of time. Linux, on the other hand, was more like \"a great babbling bazaar,\" a software program developed through the loose decentralizing dynamics of the Internet. Implicit within each analogy was a comparison of Stallman and Torvalds. Where Stallman served as the classic model of the cathedral architect-i.e., a programming \"wizard\" who could disappear for 18 months and return with something like the GNU C Compiler-Torvalds was more like a genial dinner-party host. In letting others lead the Linux design discussion and stepping in only when the entire table needed a referee, Torvalds had created a development model very much reflective of his own laid-back personality. From the Torvalds\' perspective, the most important managerial task was not imposing control but keeping the ideas flowing. Summarized Raymond, \"I think Linus\'s cleverest and most consequential hack was not the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his invention of the Linux development model.\"See Eric Raymond, \"The Cathredral and the Bazaar\" (1997). In summarizing the secrets of Torvalds\' managerial success, Raymond himself had pulled off a coup. One of the audience members at the Linux Kongress was Tim O\'Reilly, publisher of O\'Reilly & Associates, a company specializing in software manuals and software-related books (and the publisher of this book). After hearing Raymond\'s Kongress speech, O\'Reilly promptly invited Raymond to deliver it again at the company\'s inaugural Perl Conference later that year in Monterey, California. Although the conference was supposed to focus on Perl, a scripting language created by Unix hacker Larry Wall, O\'Reilly assured Raymond that the conference would address other free software technologies. Given the growing commercial interest in Linux and Apache, a popular free software web server, O\'Reilly hoped to use the event to publicize the role of free software in creating the entire infrastructure of the Internet. From web-friendly languages such as Perl and Python to back-room programs such as BIND (the Berkeley Internet Naming Daemon), a software tool that lets users replace arcane IP numbers with the easy-to-remember domain-name addresses (e.g., amazon.com), and sendmail, the most popular mail program on the Internet, free software had become an emergent phenomenon. Like a colony of ants creating a beautiful nest one grain of sand at a time, the only thing missing was the communal self-awareness. O\'Reilly saw Raymond\'s speech as a good way to inspire that self-awareness, to drive home the point that free software development didn\'t start and end with the GNU Project. Programming languages, such as Perl and Python, and Internet software, such as BIND, sendmail, and Apache, demonstrated that free software was already ubiquitous and influential. He also assured Raymond an even warmer reception than the one at Linux Kongress. O\'Reilly was right. \"This time, I got the standing ovation before the speech,\" says Raymond, laughing. As predicted, the audience was stocked not only with hackers, but with other people interested in the growing power of the free software movement. One contingent included a group from Netscape, the Mountain View, California startup then nearing the end game of its three-year battle with Microsoft for control of the web-browser market. Intrigued by Raymond\'s speech and anxious to win back lost market share, Netscape executives took the message back to corporate headquarters. A few months later, in January, 1998, the company announced its plan to publish the source code of its flagship Navigator web browser in the hopes of enlisting hacker support in future development. When Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale cited Raymond\'s \"Cathedral and the Bazaar\" essay as a major influence upon the company\'s decision, the company instantly elevated Raymond to the level of hacker celebrity. Determined not to squander the opportunity, Raymond traveled west to deliver interviews, advise Netscape executives, and take part in the eventual party celebrating the publication of Netscape Navigator\'s source code. The code name for Navigator\'s source code was \"Mozilla\": a reference both to the program\'s gargantuan size-30 million lines of code-and to its heritage. Developed as a proprietary offshoot of Mosaic, the web browser created by Marc Andreessen at the University of Illinois, Mozilla was proof, yet again, that when it came to building new programs, most programmers preferred to borrow on older, modifiable programs. While in California, Raymond also managed to squeeze in a visit to VA Research, a Santa Clara-based company selling workstations with the GNU/Linux operating system preinstalled. Convened by Raymond, the meeting was small. The invite list included VA founder Larry Augustin, a few VA employees, and Christine Peterson, president of the Foresight Institute, a Silicon Valley think tank specializing in nanotechnology. \"The meeting\'s agenda boiled down to one item: how to take advantage of Netscape\'s decision so that other companies might follow suit?\" Raymond doesn\'t recall the conversation that took place, but he does remember the first complaint addressed. Despite the best efforts of Stallman and other hackers to remind people that the word \"free\" in free software stood for freedom and not price, the message still wasn\'t getting through. Most business executives, upon hearing the term for the first time, interpreted the word as synonymous with \"zero cost,\" tuning out any follow up messages in short order. Until hackers found a way to get past this cognitive dissonance, the free software movement faced an uphill climb, even after Netscape. Peterson, whose organization had taken an active interest in advancing the free software cause, offered an alternative: open source. Looking back, Peterson says she came up with the open source term while discussing Netscape\'s decision with a friend in the public relations industry. She doesn\'t remember where she came upon the term or if she borrowed it from another field, but she does remember her friend disliking the term.5 At the meeting, Peterson says, the response was dramatically different. \"I was hesitant about suggesting it,\" Peterson recalls. \"I had no standing with the group, so started using it casually, not highlighting it as a new term.\" To Peterson\'s surprise, the term caught on. By the end of the meeting, most of the attendees, including Raymond, seemed pleased by it. Raymond says he didn\'t publicly use the term \"open source\" as a substitute for free software until a day or two after the Mozilla launch party, when O\'Reilly had scheduled a meeting to talk about free software. Calling his meeting \"the Freeware Summit,\" O\'Reilly says he wanted to direct media and community attention to the other deserving projects that had also encouraged Netscape to release Mozilla. \"All these guys had so much in common, and I was surprised they didn\'t all know each other,\" says O\'Reilly. \"I also wanted to let the world know just how great an impact the free software culture had already made. People were missing out on a large part of the free software tradition.\" In putting together the invite list, however, O\'Reilly made a decision that would have long-term political consequences. He decided to limit the list to west-coast developers such as Wall, Eric Allman, creator of sendmail, and Paul Vixie, creator of BIND. There were exceptions, of course: Pennsylvania-resident Raymond, who was already in town thanks to the Mozilla launch, earned a quick invite. So did Virginia-resident Guido van Rossum, creator of Python. \"Frank Willison, my editor in chief and champion of Python within the company, invited him without first checking in with me,\" O\'Reilly recalls. \"I was happy to have him there, but when I started, it really was just a local gathering.\" For some observers, the unwillingness to include Stallman\'s name on the list qualified as a snub. \"I decided not to go to the event because of it,\" says Perens, remembering the summit. Raymond, who did go, says he argued for Stallman\'s inclusion to no avail. The snub rumor gained additional strength from the fact that O\'Reilly, the event\'s host, had feuded publicly with Stallman over the issue of software-manual copyrights. Prior to the meeting, Stallman had argued that free software manuals should be as freely copyable and modifiable as free software programs. O\'Reilly, meanwhile, argued that a value-added market for nonfree books increased the utility of free software by making it more accessible to a wider community. The two had also disputed the title of the event, with Stallman insisting on \"Free Software\" over the less politically laden \"Freeware.\" Looking back, O\'Reilly doesn\'t see the decision to leave Stallman\'s name off the invite list as a snub. \"At that time, I had never met Richard in person, but in our email interactions, he\'d been inflexible and unwilling to engage in dialogue. I wanted to make sure the GNU tradition was represented at the meeting, so I invited John Gilmore and Michael Tiemann, whom I knew personally, and whom I knew were passionate about the value of the GPL but seemed more willing to engage in a frank back-and-forth about the strengths and weaknesses of the various free software projects and traditions. Given all the later brouhaha, I do wish I\'d invited Richard as well, but I certainly don\'t think that my failure to do so should be interpreted as a lack of respect for the GNU Project or for Richard personally.\" Snub or no snub, both O\'Reilly and Raymond say the term \"open source\" won over just enough summit-goers to qualify as a success. The attendees shared ideas and experiences and brainstormed on how to improve free software\'s image. Of key concern was how to point out the successes of free software, particularly in the realm of Internet infrastructure, as opposed to playing up the GNU/Linux challenge to Microsoft Windows. But like the earlier meeting at VA, the discussion soon turned to the problems associated with the term \"free software.\" O\'Reilly, the summit host, remembers a particularly insightful comment from Torvalds, a summit attendee. \"Linus had just moved to Silicon Valley at that point, and he explained how only recently that he had learned that the word `free\' had two meanings-free as in `libre\' and free as in `gratis\'-in English.\" Michael Tiemann, founder of Cygnus, proposed an alternative to the troublesome \"free software\" term: sourceware. \"Nobody got too excited about it,\" O\'Reilly recalls. \"That\'s when Eric threw out the term `open source.\'\" Although the term appealed to some, support for a change in official terminology was far from unanimous. At the end of the one-day conference, attendees put the three terms-free software, open source, or sourceware-to a vote. According to O\'Reilly, 9 out of the 15 attendees voted for \"open source.\" Although some still quibbled with the term, all attendees agreed to use it in future discussions with the press. \"We wanted to go out with a solidarity message,\" O\'Reilly says. The term didn\'t take long to enter the national lexicon. Shortly after the summit, O\'Reilly shepherded summit attendees to a press conference attended by reporters from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and other prominent publications. Within a few months, Torvalds\' face was appearing on the cover of Forbes magazine, with the faces of Stallman, Perl creator Larry Wall, and Apache team leader Brian Behlendorf featured in the interior spread. Open source was open for business. For summit attendees such as Tiemann, the solidarity message was the most important thing. Although his company had achieved a fair amount of success selling free software tools and services, he sensed the difficulty other programmers and entrepreneurs faced. \"There\'s no question that the use of the word free was confusing in a lot of situations,\" Tiemann says. \"Open source positioned itself as being business friendly and business sensible. Free software positioned itself as morally righteous. For better or worse we figured it was more advantageous to align with the open source crowd. For Stallman, the response to the new \"open source\" term was slow in coming. Raymond says Stallman briefly considered adopting the term, only to discard it. \"I know because I had direct personal conversations about it,\" Raymond says. By the end of 1998, Stallman had formulated a position: open source, while helpful in communicating the technical advantages of free software, also encouraged speakers to soft-pedal the issue of software freedom. Given this drawback, Stallman would stick with the term free software. Summing up his position at the 1999 LinuxWorld Convention and Expo, an event billed by Torvalds himself as a \"coming out party\" for the Linux community, Stallman implored his fellow hackers to resist the lure of easy compromise. \"Because we\'ve shown how much we can do, we don\'t have to be desperate to work with companies or compromise our goals,\" Stallman said during a panel discussion. \"Let them offer and we\'ll accept. We don\'t have to change what we\'re doing to get them to help us. You can take a single step towards a goal, then another and then more and more and you\'ll actually reach your goal. Or, you can take a half measure that means you don\'t ever take another step and you\'ll never get there.\" Even before the LinuxWorld show, however, Stallman was showing an increased willingness to alienate his more conciliatory peers. A few months after the Freeware Summit, O\'Reilly hosted its second annual Perl Conference. This time around, Stallman was in attendance. During a panel discussion lauding IBM\'s decision to employ the free software Apache web server in its commercial offerings, Stallman, taking advantage of an audience microphone, disrupted the proceedings with a tirade against panelist John Ousterhout, creator of the Tcl scripting language. Stallman branded Ousterhout a \"parasite\" on the free software community for marketing a proprietary version of Tcl via Ousterhout\'s startup company, Scriptics. \"I don\'t think Scriptics is necessary for the continued existence of Tcl,\" Stallman said to hisses from the fellow audience members.See Malcolm Maclachlan, \"Profit Motive Splits Open Source Movement,\" TechWeb News (August 26, 1998). http://content.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19980824S0012 \"It was a pretty ugly scene,\" recalls Prime Time Freeware\'s Rich Morin. \"John\'s done some pretty respectable things: Tcl, Tk, Sprite. He\'s a real contributor.\" Despite his sympathies for Stallman and Stallman\'s position, Morin felt empathy for those troubled by Stallman\'s discordant behavior. Stallman\'s Perl Conference outburst would momentarily chase off another potential sympathizer, Bruce Perens. In 1998, Eric Raymond proposed launching the Open Source Initiative, or OSI, an organization that would police the use of the term \"open source\" and provide a definition for companies interested in making their own programs. Raymond recruited Perens to draft the definition.See Bruce Perens et al., \"The Open Source Definition,\" The Open Source Initiative (1998). http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html Perens would later resign from the OSI, expressing regret that the organization had set itself up in opposition to Stallman and the FSF. Still, looking back on the need for a free software definition outside the Free Software Foundation\'s auspices, Perens understands why other hackers might still feel the need for distance. \"I really like and admire Richard,\" says Perens. \"I do think Richard would do his job better if Richard had more balance. That includes going away from free software for a couple of months.\" Stallman\'s monomaniacal energies would do little to counteract the public-relations momentum of open source proponents. In August of 1998, when chip-maker Intel purchased a stake in GNU/Linux vendor Red Hat, an accompanying New York Times article described the company as the product of a movement \"known alternatively as free software and open source.\"See Amy Harmon, \"For Sale: Free Operating System,\" New York Times (September 28, 1998). http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/09/biztech/articles/28linux.html  Six months later, a John Markoff article on Apple Computer was proclaiming the company\'s adoption of the \"open source\" Apache server in the article headline.See John Markoff, \"Apple Adopts `Open Source\' for its Server Computers,\" New York Times (March 17, 1999). http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/03/biztech/articles/17apple.html Such momentum would coincide with the growing momentum of companies that actively embraced the \"open source\" term. By August of 1999, Red Hat, a company that now eagerly billed itself as \"open source,\" was selling shares on Nasdaq. In December, VA Linux-formerly VA Research-was floating its own IPO to historical effect. Opening at $30 per share, the company\'s stock price exploded past the $300 mark in initial trading only to settle back down to the $239 level. Shareholders lucky enough to get in at the bottom and stay until the end experienced a 698% increase in paper wealth, a Nasdaq record. Among those lucky shareholders was Eric Raymond, who, as a company board member since the Mozilla launch, had received 150,000 shares of VA Linux stock. Stunned by the realization that his essay contrasting the Stallman-Torvalds managerial styles had netted him $36 million in potential wealth, Raymond penned a follow-up essay. In it, Raymond mused on the relationship between the hacker ethic and monetary wealth: Reporters often ask me these days if I think the open-source community will be corrupted by the influx of big money. I tell them what I believe, which is this: commercial demand for programmers has been so intense for so long that anyone who can be seriously distracted by money is already gone. Our community has been self-selected for caring about other things-accomplishment, pride, artistic passion, and each other.See Eric Raymond, \"Surprised by Wealth,\" Linux Today (December 10, 1999). http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-12-10-001-05-NW-LF  Whether or not such comments allayed suspicions that Raymond and other open source proponents had simply been in it for the money, they drove home the open source community\'s ultimate message: all you needed to sell the free software concept is a friendly face and a sensible message. Instead of fighting the marketplace head-on as Stallman had done, Raymond, Torvalds, and other new leaders of the hacker community had adopted a more relaxed approach-ignoring the marketplace in some areas, leveraging it in others. Instead of playing the role of high-school outcasts, they had played the game of celebrity, magnifying their power in the process. \"On his worst days Richard believes that Linus Torvalds and I conspired to hijack his revolution,\" Raymond says. \"Richard\'s rejection of the term open source and his deliberate creation of an ideological fissure in my view comes from an odd mix of idealism and territoriality. There are people out there who think it\'s all Richard\'s personal ego. I don\'t believe that. It\'s more that he so personally associates himself with the free software idea that he sees any threat to that as a threat to himself.\" Ironically, the success of open source and open source advocates such as Raymond would not diminish Stallman\'s role as a leader. If anything, it gave Stallman new followers to convert. Still, the Raymond territoriality charge is a damning one. There are numerous instances of Stallman sticking to his guns more out of habit than out of principle: his initial dismissal of the Linux kernel, for example, and his current unwillingness as a political figure to venture outside the realm of software issues. Then again, as the recent debate over open source also shows, in instances when Stallman has stuck to his guns, he\'s usually found a way to gain ground because of it. \"One of Stallman\'s primary character traits is the fact he doesn\'t budge,\" says Ian Murdock. \"He\'ll wait up to a decade for people to come around to his point of view if that\'s what it takes.\" Murdock, for one, finds that unbudgeable nature both refreshing and valuable. Stallman may no longer be the solitary leader of the free software movement, but he is still the polestar of the free software community. \"You always know that he\'s going to be consistent in his views,\" Murdock says. \"Most people aren\'t like that. Whether you agree with him or not, you really have to respect that.\" A Brief Journey Through Hacker Hell Richard Stallman stares, unblinking, through the windshield of a rental car, waiting for the light to change as we make our way through downtown Kihei. The two of us are headed to the nearby town of Pa\'ia, where we are scheduled to meet up with some software programmers and their wives for dinner in about an hour or so. It\'s about two hours after Stallman\'s speech at the Maui High Performance Center, and Kihei, a town that seemed so inviting before the speech, now seems profoundly uncooperative. Like most beach cities, Kihei is a one-dimensional exercise in suburban sprawl. Driving down its main drag, with its endless succession of burger stands, realty agencies, and bikini shops, it\'s hard not to feel like a steel-coated morsel passing through the alimentary canal of a giant commercial tapeworm. The feeling is exacerbated by the lack of side roads. With nowhere to go but forward, traffic moves in spring-like lurches. 200 yards ahead, a light turns green. By the time we are moving, the light is yellow again. For Stallman, a lifetime resident of the east coast, the prospect of spending the better part of a sunny Hawaiian afternoon trapped in slow traffic is enough to trigger an embolism. Even worse is the knowledge that, with just a few quick right turns a quarter mile back, this whole situation easily could have been avoided. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of the driver ahead of us, a programmer from the lab who knows the way and who has decided to take us to Pa\'ia via the scenic route instead of via the nearby Pilani Highway. \"This is terrible,\" says Stallman between frustrated sighs. \"Why didn\'t we take the other route?\" Again, the light a quarter mile ahead of us turns green. Again, we creep forward a few more car lengths. This process continues for another 10 minutes, until we finally reach a major crossroad promising access to the adjacent highway. The driver ahead of us ignores it and continues through the intersection. \"Why isn\'t he turning?\" moans Stallman, throwing up his hands in frustration. \"Can you believe this?\" I decide not to answer either. I find the fact that I am sitting in a car with Stallman in the driver seat, in Maui no less, unbelievable enough. Until two hours ago, I didn\'t even know Stallman knew how to drive. Now, listening to Yo-Yo Ma\'s cello playing the mournful bass notes of \"Appalachian Journey\" on the car stereo and watching the sunset pass by on our left, I do my best to fade into the upholstery. When the next opportunity to turn finally comes up, Stallman hits his right turn signal in an attempt to cue the driver ahead of us. No such luck. Once again, we creep slowly through the intersection, coming to a stop a good 200 yards before the next light. By now, Stallman is livid. \"It\'s like he\'s deliberately ignoring us,\" he says, gesturing and pantomiming like an air craft carrier landing-signals officer in a futile attempt to catch our guide\'s eye. The guide appears unfazed, and for the next five minutes all we see is a small portion of his head in the rearview mirror. I look out Stallman\'s window. Nearby Kahoolawe and Lanai Islands provide an ideal frame for the setting sun. It\'s a breathtaking view, the kind that makes moments like this a bit more bearable if you\'re a Hawaiian native, I suppose. I try to direct Stallman\'s attention to it, but Stallman, by now obsessed by the inattentiveness of the driver ahead of us, blows me off. When the driver passes through another green light, completely ignoring a \"Pilani Highway Next Right,\" I grit my teeth. I remember an early warning relayed to me by BSD programmer Keith Bostic. \"Stallman does not suffer fools gladly,\" Bostic warned me. \"If somebody says or does something stupid, he\'ll look them in the eye and say, `That\'s stupid.\'\" Looking at the oblivious driver ahead of us, I realize that it\'s the stupidity, not the inconvenience, that\'s killing Stallman right now. \"It\'s as if he picked this route with absolutely no thought on how to get there efficiently,\" Stallman says. The word \"efficiently\" hangs in the air like a bad odor. Few things irritate the hacker mind more than inefficiency. It was the inefficiency of checking the Xerox laser printer two or three times a day that triggered Stallman\'s initial inquiry into the printer source code. It was the inefficiency of rewriting software tools hijacked by commercial software vendors that led Stallman to battle Symbolics and to launch the GNU Project. If, as Jean Paul Sartre once opined, hell is other people, hacker hell is duplicating other people\'s stupid mistakes, and it\'s no exaggeration to say that Stallman\'s entire life has been an attempt to save mankind from these fiery depths. This hell metaphor becomes all the more apparent as we take in the slowly passing scenery. With its multitude of shops, parking lots, and poorly timed street lights, Kihei seems less like a city and more like a poorly designed software program writ large. Instead of rerouting traffic and distributing vehicles through side streets and expressways, city planners have elected to run everything through a single main drag. From a hacker perspective, sitting in a car amidst all this mess is like listening to a CD rendition of nails on a chalkboard at full volume. \"Imperfect systems infuriate hackers,\" observes Steven Levy, another warning I should have listened to before climbing into the car with Stallman. \"This is one reason why hackers generally hate driving cars-the system of randomly programmed red lights and oddly laid out one-way streets causes delays which are so goddamn unnecessary [Levy\'s emphasis] that the impulse is to rearrange signs, open up traffic-light control boxes . . . redesign the entire system.\"See Steven Levy, Hackers (Penguin USA [paperback], 1984): 40. More frustrating, however, is the duplicity of our trusted guide. Instead of searching out a clever shortcut-as any true hacker would do on instinct-the driver ahead of us has instead chosen to play along with the city planners\' game. Like Virgil in Dante\'s Inferno, our guide is determined to give us the full guided tour of this hacker hell whether we want it or not. Before I can make this observation to Stallman, the driver finally hits his right turn signal. Stallman\'s hunched shoulders relax slightly, and for a moment the air of tension within the car dissipates. The tension comes back, however, as the driver in front of us slows down. \"Construction Ahead\" signs line both sides of the street, and even though the Pilani Highway lies less than a quarter mile off in the distance, the two-lane road between us and the highway is blocked by a dormant bulldozer and two large mounds of dirt. It takes Stallman a few seconds to register what\'s going on as our guide begins executing a clumsy five-point U-turn in front of us. When he catches a glimpse of the bulldozer and the \"No Through Access\" signs just beyond, Stallman finally boils over. \"Why, why, why?\" he whines, throwing his head back. \"You should have known the road was blocked. You should have known this way wouldn\'t work. You did this deliberately.\" The driver finishes the turn and passes us on the way back toward the main drag. As he does so, he shakes his head and gives us an apologetic shrug. Coupled with a toothy grin, the driver\'s gesture reveals a touch of mainlander frustration but is tempered with a protective dose of islander fatalism. Coming through the sealed windows of our rental car, it spells out a succinct message: \"Hey, it\'s Maui; what are you gonna do?\" Stallman can take it no longer. \"Don\'t you fucking smile!\" he shouts, fogging up the glass as he does so. \"It\'s your fucking fault. This all could have been so much easier if we had just done it my way.\" Stallman accents the words \"my way\" by gripping the steering wheel and pulling himself towards it twice. The image of Stallman\'s lurching frame is like that of a child throwing a temper tantrum in a car seat, an image further underlined by the tone of Stallman\'s voice. Halfway between anger and anguish, Stallman seems to be on the verge of tears. Fortunately, the tears do not arrive. Like a summer cloudburst, the tantrum ends almost as soon as it begins. After a few whiny gasps, Stallman shifts the car into reverse and begins executing his own U-turn. By the time we are back on the main drag, his face is as impassive as it was when we left the hotel 30 minutes earlier. ');

This one offers easy highway access, and within seconds, we are soon speeding off toward Pa\'ia at a relaxing rate of speed. The sun that once loomed bright and yellow over Stallman\'s left shoulder is now burning a cool orange-red in our rearview mirror. It lends its color to the gauntlet wili wili trees flying past us on both sides of the highway. For the next 20 minutes, the only sound in our vehicle, aside from the ambient hum of the car\'s engine and tires, is the sound of a cello and a violin trio playing the mournful strains of an Appalachian folk tune. Endnote Continuing the Fight For Richard Stallman, time may not heal all wounds, but it does provide a convenient ally. Four years after \" The Cathedral and the Bazaar,\" Stallman still chafes over the Raymond critique. He also grumbles over Linus Torvalds\' elevation to the role of world\'s most famous hacker. He recalls a popular T-shirt that began showing at Linux tradeshows around 1999. Designed to mimic the original promotional poster for Star Wars, the shirt depicted Torvalds brandishing a lightsaber like Luke Skywalker, while Stallman\'s face rides atop R2D2. The shirt still grates on Stallmans nerves not only because it depicts him as a Torvalds\' sidekick, but also because it elevates Torvalds to the leadership role in the free software/open source community, a role even Torvalds himself is loath to accept. \"It\'s ironic,\" says Stallman mournfully. \"Picking up that sword is exactly what Linus refuses to do. He gets everybody focusing on him as the symbol of the movement, and then he won\'t fight. What good is it?\" Then again, it is that same unwillingness to \"pick up the sword,\" on Torvalds part, that has left the door open for Stallman to bolster his reputation as the hacker community\'s ethical arbiter. Despite his grievances, Stallman has to admit that the last few years have been quite good, both to himself and to his organization. Relegated to the periphery by the unforeseen success of GNU/Linux, Stallman has nonetheless successfully recaptured the initiative. His speaking schedule between January 2000 and December 2001 included stops on six continents and visits to countries where the notion of software freedom carries heavy overtones-China and India, for example. Outside the bully pulpit, Stallman has also learned how to leverage his power as costeward of the GNU General Public License (GPL). During the summer of 2000, while the air was rapidly leaking out of the 1999 Linux IPO bubble, Stallman and the Free Software Foundation scored two major victories. In July, 2000, Troll Tech, a Norwegian software company and developer of Qt, a valuable suite of graphics tools for the GNU/Linux operating system, announced it was licensing its software under the GPL. A few weeks later, Sun Microsystems, a company that, until then, had been warily trying to ride the open source bandwagon without giving up total control of its software properties, finally relented and announced that it, too, was dual licensing its new OpenOffice application suite under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) and the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL). Underlining each victory was the fact that Stallman had done little to fight for them. In the case of Troll Tech, Stallman had simply played the role of free software pontiff. In 1999, the company had come up with a license that met the conditions laid out by the Free Software Foundation, but in examining the license further, Stallman detected legal incompatibles that would make it impossible to bundle Qt with GPL-protected software programs. Tired of battling Stallman, Troll Tech management finally decided to split the Qt into two versions, one GPL-protected and one QPL-protected, giving developers a way around the compatibility issues cited by Stallman. In the case of Sun, they desired to play according to the Free Software Foundation\'s conditions. At the 1999 O\'Reilly Open Source Conference, Sun Microsystems cofounder and chief scientist Bill Joy defended his company\'s \"community source\" license, essentially a watered-down compromise letting users copy and modify Sun-owned software but not charge a fee for said software without negotiating a royalty agreement with Sun. A year after Joy\'s speech, Sun Microsystems vice president Marco Boerries was appearing on the same stage spelling out the company\'s new licensing compromise in the case of OpenOffice, an office-application suite designed specifically for the GNU/Linux operating system. \"I can spell it out in three letters,\" said Boerries. \"GPL.\" At the time, Boerries said his company\'s decision had little to do with Stallman and more to do with the momentum of GPL-protected programs. \"What basically happened was the recognition that different products attracted different communities, and the license you use depends on what type of community you want to attract,\" said Boerries. \"With [OpenOffice], it was clear we had the highest correlation with the GPL community.\"See Marco Boerries, interview with author (July, 2000). Such comments point out the under-recognized strength of the GPL and, indirectly, the political genius of man who played the largest role in creating it. \"There isn\'t a lawyer on earth who would have drafted the GPL the way it is,\" says Eben Moglen, Columbia University law professor and Free Software Foundation general counsel. \"But it works. And it works because of Richard\'s philosophy of design.\" A former professional programmer, Moglen traces his pro bono work with Stallman back to 1990 when Stallman requested Moglen\'s legal assistance on a private affair. Moglen, then working with encryption expert Phillip Zimmerman during Zimmerman\'s legal battles with the National Security Administration, says he was honored by the request. \"I told him I used Emacs every day of my life, and it would take an awful lot of lawyering on my part to pay off the debt.\" Since then, Moglen, perhaps more than any other individual, has had the best chance to observe the crossover of Stallman\'s hacker philosophies into the legal realm. Moglen says the difference between Stallman\'s approach to legal code and software code are largely the same. \"I have to say, as a lawyer, the idea that what you should do with a legal document is to take out all the bugs doesn\'t make much sense,\" Moglen says. \"There is uncertainty in every legal process, and what most lawyers want to do is to capture the benefits of uncertainty for their client. Richard\'s goal is the complete opposite. His goal is to remove uncertainty, which is inherently impossible. It is inherently impossible to draft one license to control all circumstances in all legal systems all over the world. But if you were to go at it, you would have to go at it his way. And the resulting elegance, the resulting simplicity in design almost achieves what it has to achieve. And from there a little lawyering will carry you quite far.\" As the person charged with pushing the Stallman agenda, Moglen understands the frustration of would-be allies. \"Richard is a man who does not want to compromise over matters that he thinks of as fundamental,\" Moglen says, \"and he does not take easily the twisting of words or even just the seeking of artful ambiguity, which human society often requires from a lot of people.\" Because of the Free Software Foundation\'s unwillingness to weigh in on issues outside the purview of GNU development and GPL enforcement, Moglen has taken to devoting his excess energies to assisting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the organization providing legal aid to recent copyright defendants such as Dmitri Skylarov. In 2000, Moglen also served as direct counsel to a collection of hackers that were joined together from circulating the DVD decryption program deCSS. Despite the silence of his main client in both cases, Moglen has learned to appreciate the value of Stallman\'s stubbornness. \"There have been times over the years where I\'ve gone to Richard and said, `We have to do this. We have to do that. Here\'s the strategic situation. Here\'s the next move. Here\'s what he have to do.\' And Richard\'s response has always been, `We don\'t have to do anything.\' Just wait. What needs doing will get done.\" \"And you know what?\" Moglen adds. \"Generally, he\'s been right.\" Such comments disavow Stallman\'s own self-assessment: \"I\'m not good at playing games,\" Stallman says, addressing the many unseen critics who see him as a shrewd strategist. \"I\'m not good at looking ahead and anticipating what somebody else might do. My approach has always been to focus on the foundation, to say `Let\'s make the foundation as strong as we can make it.\'\" The GPL\'s expanding popularity and continuing gravitational strength are the best tributes to the foundation laid by Stallman and his GNU colleagues. While no longer capable of billing himself as the \"last true hacker,\" Stallman nevertheless can take sole credit for building the free software movement\'s ethical framework. Whether or not other modern programmers feel comfortable working inside that framework is immaterial. The fact that they even have a choice at all is Stallman\'s greatest legacy. Discussing Stallman\'s legacy at this point seems a bit premature. Stallman, 48 at the time of this writing, still has a few years left to add to or subtract from that legacy. Still, the autopilot nature of the free software movement makes it tempting to examine Stallman\'s life outside the day-to-day battles of the software industry and within a more august, historical setting. To his credit, Stallman refuses all opportunities to speculate. \"I\'ve never been able to work out detailed plans of what the future was going to be like,\" says Stallman, offering his own premature epitaph. \"I just said `I\'m going to fight. Who knows where I\'ll get?\'\" There\'s no question that in picking his fights, Stallman has alienated the very people who might otherwise have been his greatest champions. It is also a testament to his forthright, ethical nature that many of Stallman\'s erstwhile political opponents still manage to put in a few good words for him when pressed. The tension between Stallman the ideologue and Stallman the hacker genius, however, leads a biographer to wonder: how will people view Stallman when Stallman\'s own personality is no longer there to get in the way? In early drafts of this book, I dubbed this question the \"100 year\" question. Hoping to stimulate an objective view of Stallman and his work, I asked various software-industry luminaries to take themselves out of the current timeframe and put themselves in a position of a historian looking back on the free software movement 100 years in the future. From the current vantage point, it is easy to see similarities between Stallman and past Americans who, while somewhat marginal during their lifetime, have attained heightened historical importance in relation to their age. Easy comparisons include Henry David Thoreau, transcendentalist philosopher and author of On Civil Disobedience, and John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club and progenitor of the modern environmental movement. It is also easy to see similarities in men like William Jennings Bryan, a.k.a. \"The Great Commoner,\" leader of the populist movement, enemy of monopolies, and a man who, though powerful, seems to have faded into historical insignificance. Although not the first person to view software as public property, Stallman is guaranteed a footnote in future history books thanks to the GPL. Given that fact, it seems worthwhile to step back and examine Richard Stallman\'s legacy outside the current time frame. Will the GPL still be something software programmers use in the year 2102, or will it have long since fallen by the wayside? Will the term \"free software\" seem as politically quaint as \"free silver\" does today, or will it seem eerily prescient in light of later political events? Predicting the future is risky sport, but most people, when presented with the question, seemed eager to bite. \"One hundred years from now, Richard and a couple of other people are going to deserve more than a footnote,\" says Moglen. \"They\'re going to be viewed as the main line of the story.\" The \"couple other people\" Moglen nominates for future textbook chapters include John Gilmore, Stallman\'s GPL advisor and future founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Theodor Holm Nelson, a.k.a. Ted Nelson, author of the 1982 book, Literary Machines . Moglen says Stallman, Nelson, and Gilmore each stand out in historically significant, nonoverlapping ways. He credits Nelson, commonly considered to have coined the term \"hypertext,\" for identifying the predicament of information ownership in the digital age. Gilmore and Stallman, meanwhile, earn notable credit for identifying the negative political effects of information control and building organizations-the Electronic Frontier Foundation in the case of Gilmore and the Free Software Foundation in the case of Stallman-to counteract those effects. Of the two, however, Moglen sees Stallman\'s activities as more personal and less political in nature. \"Richard was unique in that the ethical implications of unfree software were particularly clear to him at an early moment,\" says Moglen. \"This has a lot to do with Richard\'s personality, which lots of people will, when writing about him, try to depict as epiphenomenal or even a drawback in Richard Stallman\'s own life work.\" Gilmore, who describes his inclusion between the erratic Nelson and the irascible Stallman as something of a \"mixed honor,\" nevertheless seconds the Moglen argument. Writes Gilmore: My guess is that Stallman\'s writings will stand up as well as Thomas Jefferson\'s have; he\'s a pretty clear writer and also clear on his principles . . . Whether Richard will be as influential as Jefferson will depend on whether the abstractions we call \"civil rights\" end up more important a hundred years from now than the abstractions that we call \"software\" or \"technically imposed restrictions.\" Another element of the Stallman legacy not to be overlooked, Gilmore writes, is the collaborative software-development model pioneered by the GNU Project. Although flawed at times, the model has nevertheless evolved into a standard within the software-development industry. All told, Gilmore says, this collaborative software-development model may end up being even more influential than the GNU Project, the GPL License, or any particular software program developed by Stallman: Before the Internet, it was quite hard to collaborate over distance on software, even among teams that know and trust each other. Richard pioneered collaborative development of software, particularly by disorganized volunteers who seldom meet each other. Richard didn\'t build any of the basic tools for doing this (the TCP protocol, email lists, diff and patch, tar files, RCS or CVS or remote-CVS), but he used the ones that were available to form social groups of programmers who could effectively collaborate. Lawrence Lessig, Stanford law professor and author of the 2001 book, The Future of Ideas , is similarly bullish. Like many legal scholars, Lessig sees the GPL as a major bulwark of the current so-called \"digital commons,\" the vast agglomeration of community-owned software programs, network and telecommunication standards that have triggered the Internet\'s exponential growth over the last three decades. Rather than connect Stallman with other Internet pioneers, men such as Vannevar Bush, Vinton Cerf, and J. C. R. Licklider who convinced others to see computer technology on a wider scale, Lessig sees Stallman\'s impact as more personal, introspective, and, ultimately, unique: [Stallman] changed the debate from is to ought. He made people see how much was at stake, and he built a device to carry these ideals forward . . . That said, I don\'t quite know how to place him in the context of Cerf or Licklider. The innovation is different. It is not just about a certain kind of code, or enabling the Internet. [It\'s] much more about getting people to see the value in a certain kind of Internet. I don\'t think there is anyone else in that class, before or after. Not everybody sees the Stallman legacy as set in stone, of course. Eric Raymond, the open source proponent who feels that Stallman\'s leadership role has diminished significantly since 1996, sees mixed signals when looking into the 2102 crystal ball: I think Stallman\'s artifacts (GPL, Emacs, GCC) will be seen as revolutionary works, as foundation-stones of the information world. I think history will be less kind to some of the theories from which RMS operated, and not kind at all to his personal tendency towards territorial, cult-leader behavior. As for Stallman himself, he, too, sees mixed signals: What history says about the GNU Project, twenty years from now, will depend on who wins the battle of freedom to use public knowledge. If we lose, we will be just a footnote. If we win, it is uncertain whether people will know the role of the GNU operating system-if they think the system is \"Linux,\" they will build a false picture of what happened and why. But even if we win, what history people learn a hundred years from now is likely to depend on who dominates politically. Searching for his own 19th-century historical analogy, Stallman summons the figure of John Brown, the militant abolitionist regarded as a hero on one side of the Mason Dixon line and a madman on the other. John Brown\'s slave revolt never got going, but during his subsequent trial he effectively roused national demand for abolition. During the Civil War, John Brown was a hero; 100 years after, and for much of the 1900s, history textbooks taught that he was crazy. During the era of legal segregation, while bigotry was shameless, the US partly accepted the story that the South wanted to tell about itself, and history textbooks said many untrue things about the Civil War and related events. Such comparisons document both the self-perceived peripheral nature of Stallman\'s current work and the binary nature of his current reputation. Although it\'s hard to see Stallman\'s reputation falling to the level of infamy as Brown\'s did during the post-Reconstruction period-Stallman, despite his occasional war-like analogies, has done little to inspire violence-it\'s easy to envision a future in which Stallman\'s ideas wind up on the ash-heap. In fashioning the free software cause not as a mass movement but as a collection of private battles against the forces of proprietary temptation, Stallman seems to have created a unwinnable situation, especially for the many acolytes with the same stubborn will. Then again, it is that very will that may someday prove to be Stallman\'s greatest lasting legacy. Moglen, a close observer over the last decade, warns those who mistake the Stallman personality as counter-productive or epiphenomenal to the \"artifacts\" of Stalllman\'s life. Without that personality, Moglen says, there would be precious few artifiacts to discuss. Says Moglen, a former Supreme Court clerk: Look, the greatest man I ever worked for was Thurgood Marshall. I knew what made him a great man. I knew why he had been able to change the world in his possible way. I would be going out on a limb a little bit if I were to make a comparison, because they could not be more different. Thurgood Marshall was a man in society, representing an outcast society to the society that enclosed it, but still a man in society. His skill was social skills. But he was all of a piece, too. Different as they were in every other respect, that the person I most now compare him to in that sense, all of a piece, compact, made of the substance that makes stars, all the way through, is Stallman. In an effort to drive that image home, Moglen reflects on a shared moment in the spring of 2000. The success of the VA Linux IPO was still resonating in the business media, and a half dozen free software-related issues were swimming through the news. Surrounded by a swirling hurricane of issues and stories each begging for comment, Moglen recalls sitting down for lunch with Stallman and feeling like a castaway dropped into the eye of the storm. For the next hour, he says, the conversation calmly revolved around a single topic: strengthening the GPL. \"We were sitting there talking about what we were going to do about some problems in Eastern Europe and what we were going to do when the problem of the ownership of content began to threaten free software,\" Moglen recalls. \"As we were talking, I briefly thought about how we must have looked to people passing by. Here we are, these two little bearded anarchists, plotting and planning the next steps. And, of course, Richard is plucking the knots from his hair and dropping them in the soup and behaving in his usual way. Anybody listening in on our conversation would have thought we were crazy, but I knew: I knew the revolution\'s right here at this table. This is what\'s making it happen. And this man is the person making it happen.\" Moglen says that moment, more than any other, drove home the elemental simplicity of the Stallman style. \"It was funny,\" recalls Moglen. \"I said to him, `Richard, you know, you and I are the two guys who didn\'t make any money out of this revolution.\' And then I paid for the lunch, because I knew he didn\'t have the money to pay for it .\'\" Endnote Epilogue: Crushing Loneliness Writing the biography of a living person is a bit like producing a play. The drama in front of the curtain often pales in comparison to the drama backstage. In The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Alex Haley gives readers a rare glimpse of that backstage drama. Stepping out of the ghostwriter role, Haley delivers the book\'s epilogue in his own voice. The epilogue explains how a freelance reporter originally dismissed as a \"tool\" and \"spy\" by the Nation of Islam spokesperson managed to work through personal and political barriers to get Malcolm X\'s life story on paper. While I hesitate to compare this book with The Autobiography of Malcolm X, I do owe a debt of gratitude to Haley for his candid epilogue. Over the last 12 months, it has served as a sort of instruction manual on how to deal with a biographical subject who has built an entire career on being disagreeable. From the outset, I envisioned closing this biography with a similar epilogue, both as an homage to Haley and as a way to let readers know how this book came to be. The story behind this story starts in an Oakland apartment, winding its way through the various locales mentioned in the book-Silicon Valley, Maui, Boston, and Cambridge. Ultimately, however, it is a tale of two cities: New York, New York, the book-publishing capital of the world, and Sebastopol, California, the book-publishing capital of Sonoma County. The story starts in April, 2000. At the time, I was writing stories for the ill-fated BeOpen web site (http://www.beopen.com/). One of my first assignments was a phone interview with Richard M. Stallman. The interview went well, so well that Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org/), the popular \"news for nerds\" site owned by VA Software, Inc. (formerly VA Linux Systems and before that, VA Research), gave it a link in its daily list of feature stories. Within hours, the web servers at BeOpen were heating up as readers clicked over to the site. For all intents and purposes, the story should have ended there. Three months after the interview, while attending the O\'Reilly Open Source Conference in Monterey, California, I received the following email message from Tracy Pattison, foreign-rights manager at a large New York publishing house: To: sam@BeOpen.com Subject: RMS InterviewDate: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 15:56:37 -0400Dear Mr. Williams, I read your interview with Richard Stallman on BeOpen with great interest. I\'ve been intrigued by RMS and his work for some time now and was delighted to find your piece which I really think you did a great job of capturing some of the spirit of what Stallman is trying to do with GNU-Linux and the Free Software Foundation. What I\'d love to do, however, is read more - and I don\'t think I\'m alone. Do you think there is more information and/or sources out there to expand and update your interview and adapt it into more of a profile of Stallman? Perhaps including some more anecdotal information about his personality and background that might really interest and enlighten readers outside the more hardcore programming scene? The email asked that I give Tracy a call to discuss the idea further. I did just that. Tracy told me her company was launching a new electronic book line, and it wanted stories that appealed to an early-adopter audience. The e-book format was 30,000 words, about 100 pages, and she had pitched her bosses on the idea of profiling a major figure in the hacker community. Her bosses liked the idea, and in the process of searching for interesting people to profile, she had come across my BeOpen interview with Stallman. Hence her email to me. That\'s when Tracy asked me: would I be willing to expand the interview into a full-length feature profile? My answer was instant: yes. Before accepting it, Tracy suggested I put together a story proposal she could show her superiors. Two days later, I sent her a polished proposal. A week later, Tracy sent me a follow up email. Her bosses had given it the green light. I have to admit, getting Stallman to participate in an e-book project was an afterthought on my part. As a reporter who covered the open source beat, I knew Stallman was a stickler. I\'d already received a half dozen emails at that point upbraiding me for the use of \"Linux\" instead of \"GNU/Linux.\" Then again, I also knew Stallman was looking for ways to get his message out to the general public. Perhaps if I presented the project to him that way, he would be more receptive. If not, I could always rely upon the copious amounts of documents, interviews, and recorded online conversations Stallman had left lying around the Internet and do an unauthorized biography. During my research, I came across an essay titled \"Freedom-Or Copyright?\" Written by Stallman and published in the June, 2000, edition of the MIT Technology Review, the essay blasted e-books for an assortment of software sins. Not only did readers have to use proprietary software programs to read them, Stallman lamented, but the methods used to prevent unauthorized copying were overly harsh. Instead of downloading a transferable HTML or PDF file, readers downloaded an encrypted file. In essence, purchasing an e-book meant purchasing a nontransferable key to unscramble the encrypted content. Any attempt to open a book\'s content without an authorized key constituted a criminal violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the 1998 law designed to bolster copyright enforcement on the Internet. Similar penalties held for readers who converted a book\'s content into an open file format, even if their only intention was to read the book on a different computer in their home. Unlike a normal book, the reader no longer held the right to lend, copy, or resell an e-book. They only had the right to read it on an authorized machine, warned Stallman: We still have the same old freedoms in using paper books. But if e-books replace printed books, that exception will do little good. With \"electronic ink,\" which makes it possible to download new text onto an apparently printed piece of paper, even newspapers could become ephemeral. Imagine: no more used book stores; no more lending a book to your friend; no more borrowing one from the public library-no more \"leaks\" that might give someone a chance to read without paying. (And judging from the ads for Microsoft Reader, no more anonymous purchasing of books either.) This is the world publishers have in mind for us.See \"Safari Tech Books Online; Subscriber Agreement: Terms of Service.\" http://safari.oreilly.com/mainhlp.asp?help=service Needless to say, the essay caused some concern. Neither Tracy nor I had discussed the software her company would use nor had we discussed the type of copyright that would govern the e-book\'s usage. I mentioned the Technology Review article and asked if she could give me information on her company\'s e-book policies. Tracy promised to get back to me. Eager to get started, I decided to call Stallman anyway and mention the book idea to him. When I did, he expressed immediate interest and immediate concern. \"Did you read my essay on e-books?\" he asked. When I told him, yes, I had read the essay and was waiting to hear back from the publisher, Stallman laid out two conditions: he didn\'t want to lend support to an e-book licensing mechanism he fundamentally opposed, and he didn\'t want to come off as lending support. \"I don\'t want to participate in anything that makes me look like a hypocrite,\" he said. For Stallman, the software issue was secondary to the copyright issue. He said he was willing to ignore whatever software the publisher or its third-party vendors employed just so long as the company specified within the copyright that readers were free to make and distribute verbatim copies of the e-book\'s content. Stallman pointed to Stephen King\'s The Plant as a possible model. In June, 2000, King announced on his official web site that he was self-publishing The Plant in serial form. According to the announcement, the book\'s total cost would be $13, spread out over a series of $1 installments. As long as at least 75% of the readers paid for each chapter, King promised to continue releasing new installments. By August, the plan seemed to be working, as King had published the first two chapters with a third on the way. \"I\'d be willing to accept something like that,\" Stallman said. \"As long as it also permitted verbatim copying.\" I forwarded the information to Tracy. Feeling confident that she and I might be able to work out an equitable arrangement, I called up Stallman and set up the first interview for the book. Stallman agreed to the interview without making a second inquiry into the status issue. Shortly after the first interview, I raced to set up a second interview (this one in Kihei), squeezing it in before Stallman headed off on a 14-day vacation to Tahiti. It was during Stallman\'s vacation that the bad news came from Tracy. Her company\'s legal department didn\'t want to adjust its copyright notice on the e-books. Readers who wanted to make their books transferable would either have to crack the encryption code or convert the book to an open format such as HTML. Either way, the would be breaking the law and facing criminal penalties. With two fresh interviews under my belt, I didn\'t see any way to write the book without resorting to the new material. I quickly set up a trip to New York to meet with my agent and with Tracy to see if there was a compromise solution. When I flew to New York, I met my agent, Henning Guttman. It was our first face-to-face meeting, and Henning seemed pessimistic about our chances of forcing a compromise, at least on the publisher\'s end. The large, established publishing houses already viewed the e-book format with enough suspicion and weren\'t in the mood to experiment with copyright language that made it easier for readers to avoid payment. As an agent who specialized in technology books, however, Henning was intrigued by the novel nature of my predicament. I told him about the two interviews I\'d already gathered and the promise not to publish the book in a way that made Stallman \"look like a hypocrite.\" Agreeing that I was in an ethical bind, Henning suggested we make that our negotiating point. Barring that, Henning said, we could always take the carrot-and-stick approach. The carrot would be the publicity that came with publishing an e-book that honored the hacker community\'s internal ethics. The stick would be the risks associated with publishing an e-book that didn\'t. Nine months before Dmitri Skylarov became an Internet cause celebre, we knew it was only a matter of time before an enterprising programmer revealed how to hack e-books. We also knew that a major publishing house releasing an encryption-protected e-book on Richard M. Stallman was the software equivalent of putting \"Steal This E-Book\" on the cover. After my meeting with Henning, I put a call into Stallman. Hoping to make the carrot more enticing, I discussed a number of potential compromises. What if the publisher released the book\'s content under a split license, something similar to what Sun Microsystems had done with Open Office, the free software desktop applications suite? The publisher could then release commercial versions of the e-book under a normal format, taking advantage of all the bells and whistles that went with the e-book software, while releasing the copyable version under a less aesthetically pleasing HTML format. Stallman told me he didn\'t mind the split-license idea, but he did dislike the idea of making the freely copyable version inferior to the restricted version. Besides, he said, the idea was too cumbersome. Split licenses worked in the case of Sun\'s Open Office only because he had no control over the decision making. In this case, Stallman said, he did have a way to control the outcome. He could refuse to cooperate. I made a few more suggestions with little effect. About the only thing I could get out of Stallman was a concession that the e-book\'s copyright restrict all forms of file sharing to \"noncommercial redistribution.\" Before I signed off, Stallman suggested I tell the publisher that I\'d promised Stallman that the work would be free. I told Stallman I couldn\'t agree to that statement but that I did view the book as unfinishable without his cooperation. Seemingly satisfied, Stallman hung up with his usual sign-off line: \"Happy hacking.\" Henning and I met with Tracy the next day. Tracy said her company was willing to publish copyable excerpts in a unencrypted format but would limit the excerpts to 500 words. Henning informed her that this wouldn\'t be enough for me to get around my ethical obligation to Stallman. Tracy mentioned her own company\'s contractual obligation to online vendors such as Amazon.com. Even if the company decided to open up its e-book content this one time, it faced the risk of its partners calling it a breach of contract. Barring a change of heart in the executive suite or on the part of Stallman, the decision was up to me. I could use the interviews and go against my earlier agreement with Stallman, or I could plead journalistic ethics and back out of the verbal agreement to do the book. Following the meeting, my agent and I relocated to a pub on Third Ave. I used his cell phone to call Stallman, leaving a message when nobody answered. Henning left for a moment, giving me time to collect my thoughts. When he returned, he was holding up the cell phone. \"It\'s Stallman,\" Henning said. The conversation got off badly from the start. I relayed Tracy\'s comment about the publisher\'s contractual obligations. \"So,\" Stallman said bluntly. \"Why should I give a damn about their contractual obligations?\" Because asking a major publishing house to risk a legal battle with its vendors over a 30,000 word e-book is a tall order, I suggested. \"Don\'t you see?\" Stallman said. \"That\'s exactly why I\'m doing this. I want a signal victory. I want them to make a choice between freedom and business as usual.\" As the words \"signal victory\" echoed in my head, I felt my attention wander momentarily to the passing foot traffic on the sidewalk. Coming into the bar, I had been pleased to notice that the location was less than half a block away from the street corner memorialized in the 1976 Ramones song, \"53rd and 3rd,\" a song I always enjoyed playing in my days as a musician. Like the perpetually frustrated street hustler depicted in that song, I could feel things falling apart as quickly as they had come together. The irony was palpable. After weeks of gleefully recording other people\'s laments, I found myself in the position of trying to pull off the rarest of feats: a Richard Stallman compromise. When I continued hemming and hawing, pleading the publisher\'s position and revealing my growing sympathy for it, Stallman, like an animal smelling blood, attacked. \"So that\'s it? You\'re just going to screw me? You\'re just going to bend to their will?\" I brought up the issue of a dual-copyright again. \"You mean license,\" Stallman said curtly. \"Yeah, license. Copyright. Whatever,\" I said, feeling suddenly like a wounded tuna trailing a rich plume of plasma in the water. \"Aw, why didn\'t you just fucking do what I told you to do!\" he shouted. I must have been arguing on behalf of the publisher to the very end, because in my notes I managed to save a final Stallman chestnut: \"I don\'t care. What they\'re doing is evil. I can\'t support evil. Good-bye.\" As soon as I put the phone down, my agent slid a freshly poured Guinness to me. \"I figured you might need this,\" he said with a laugh. \"I could see you shaking there towards the end.\" I was indeed shaking. The shaking wouldn\'t stop until the Guinness was more than halfway gone. It felt weird, hearing myself characterized as an emissary of \"evil.\" It felt weirder still, knowing that three months before, I was sitting in an Oakland apartment trying to come up with my next story idea. Now, I was sitting in a part of the world I\'d only known through rock songs, taking meetings with publishing executives and drinking beer with an agent I\'d never even laid eyes on until the day before. It was all too surreal, like watching my life reflected back as a movie montage. About that time, my internal absurdity meter kicked in. The initial shaking gave way to convulsions of laughter. To my agent, I must have looked like a another fragile author undergoing an untimely emotional breakdown. To me, I was just starting to appreciate the cynical beauty of my situation. Deal or no deal, I already had the makings of a pretty good story. It was only a matter of finding a place to tell it. When my laughing convulsions finally subsided, I held up my drink in a toast. \"Welcome to the front lines, my friend,\" I said, clinking pints with my agent. \"Might as well enjoy it.\" If this story really were a play, here\'s where it would take a momentary, romantic interlude. Disheartened by the tense nature of our meeting, Tracy invited Henning and I to go out for drinks with her and some of her coworkers. We left the bar on Third Ave., headed down to the East Village, and caught up with Tracy and her friends. Once there, I spoke with Tracy, careful to avoid shop talk. Our conversation was pleasant, relaxed. Before parting, we agreed to meet the next night. Once again, the conversation was pleasant, so pleasant that the Stallman e-book became almost a distant memory. When I got back to Oakland, I called around to various journalist friends and acquaintances. I recounted my predicament. Most upbraided me for giving up too much ground to Stallman in the preinterview negotiation. A former j-school professor suggested I ignore Stallman\'s \"hypocrite\" comment and just write the story. Reporters who knew of Stallman\'s media-savviness expressed sympathy but uniformly offered the same response: it\'s your call. I decided to put the book on the back burner. Even with the interviews, I wasn\'t making much progress. Besides, it gave me a chance to speak with Tracy without running things past Henning first. By Christmas we had traded visits: she flying out to the west coast once, me flying out to New York a second time. The day before New Year\'s Eve, I proposed. Deciding which coast to live on, I picked New York. By February, I packed up my laptop computer and all my research notes related to the Stallman biography, and we winged our way to JFK Airport. Tracy and I were married on May 11. So much for failed book deals. During the summer, I began to contemplate turning my interview notes into a magazine article. Ethically, I felt in the clear doing so, since the original interview terms said nothing about traditional print media. To be honest, I also felt a bit more comfortable writing about Stallman after eight months of radio silence. Since our telephone conversation in September, I\'d only received two emails from Stallman. Both chastised me for using \"Linux\" instead of \"GNU/Linux\" in a pair of articles for the web magazine Upside Today. Aside from that, I had enjoyed the silence. In June, about a week after the New York University speech, I took a crack at writing a 5,000-word magazine-length story about Stallman. This time, the words flowed. The distance had helped restore my lost sense of emotional perspective, I suppose. In July, a full year after the original email from Tracy, I got a call from Henning. He told me that O\'Reilly & Associates, a publishing house out of Sebastopol, California, was interested in the running the Stallman story as a biography. The news pleased me. Of all the publishing houses in the world, O\'Reilly, the same company that had published Eric Raymond\'s The Cathedral and the Bazaar, seemed the most sensitive to the issues that had killed the earlier e-book. As a reporter, I had relied heavily on the O\'Reilly book Open Sources as a historical reference. I also knew that various chapters of the book, including a chapter written by Stallman, had been published with copyright notices that permitted redistribution. Such knowledge would come in handy if the issue of electronic publication ever came up again. Sure enough, the issue did come up. I learned through Henning that O\'Reilly intended to publish the biography both as a book and as part of its new Safari Tech Books Online subscription service. The Safari user license would involve special restrictions,1 Henning warned, but O\'Reilly was willing to allow for a copyright that permitted users to copy and share and the book\'s text regardless of medium. Basically, as author, I had the choice between two licenses: the Open Publication License or the GNU Free Documentation License. I checked out the contents and background of each license. The Open Publication License (OPL)See \"The Open Publication License: Draft v1.0\" (June 8, 1999). http://opencontent.org/openpub/  gives readers the right to reproduce and distribute a work, in whole or in part, in any medium \"physical or electronic,\" provided the copied work retains the Open Publication License. It also permits modification of a work, provided certain conditions are met. Finally, the Open Publication License includes a number of options, which, if selected by the author, can limit the creation of \"substantively modified\" versions or book-form derivatives without prior author approval. The GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL),See \"The GNU Free Documentation License: Version 1.1\" (March, 2000). http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html  meanwhile, permits the copying and distribution of a document in any medium, provided the resulting work carries the same license. It also permits the modification of a document provided certain conditions. Unlike the OPL, however, it does not give authors the option to restrict certain modifications. It also does not give authors the right to reject modifications that might result in a competitive book product. It does require certain forms of front- and back-cover information if a party other than the copyright holder wishes to publish more than 100 copies of a protected work, however. In the course of researching the licenses, I also made sure to visit the GNU Project web page titled \"Various Licenses and Comments About Them.\"See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html On that page, I found a Stallman critique of the Open Publication License. Stallman\'s critique related to the creation of modified works and the ability of an author to select either one of the OPL\'s options to restrict modification. If an author didn\'t want to select either option, it was better to use the GFDL instead, Stallman noted, since it minimized the risk of the nonselected options popping up in modified versions of a document. The importance of modification in both licenses was a reflection of their original purpose-namely, to give software-manual owners a chance to improve their manuals and publicize those improvements to the rest of the community. Since my book wasn\'t a manual, I had little concern about the modification clause in either license. My only concern was giving users the freedom to exchange copies of the book or make copies of the content, the same freedom they would have enjoyed if they purchased a hardcover book. Deeming either license suitable for this purpose, I signed the O\'Reilly contract when it came to me. Still, the notion of unrestricted modification intrigued me. In my early negotiations with Tracy, I had pitched the merits of a GPL-style license for the e-book\'s content. At worst, I said, the license would guarantee a lot of positive publicity for the e-book. At best, it would encourage readers to participate in the book-writing process. As an author, I was willing to let other people amend my work just so long as my name always got top billing. Besides, it might even be interesting to watch the book evolve. I pictured later editions looking much like online versions of the Talmud, my original text in a central column surrounded by illuminating, third-party commentary in the margins. My idea drew inspiration from Project Xanadu (http://www.xanadu.com/), the legendary software concept originally conceived by Ted Nelson in 1960. During the O\'Reilly Open Source Conference in 1999, I had seen the first demonstration of the project\'s open source offshoot Udanax and had been wowed by the result. In one demonstration sequence, Udanax displayed a parent document and a derivative work in a similar two-column, plain-text format. With a click of the button, the program introduced lines linking each sentence in the parent to its conceptual offshoot in the derivative. An e-book biography of Richard M. Stallman didn\'t have to be Udanax-enabled, but given such technological possibilities, why not give users a chance to play around?Anybody willing to \"port\" this book over to Udanax, the free software version of Xanadu, will receive enthusiastic support from me. To find out more about this intriguing technology, visit http://www.udanax.com/. When Laurie Petrycki, my editor at O\'Reilly, gave me a choice between the OPL or the GFDL, I indulged the fantasy once again. By September of 2001, the month I signed the contract, e-books had become almost a dead topic. Many publishing houses, Tracy\'s included, were shutting down their e-book imprints for lack of interest. I had to wonder. If these companies had treated e-books not as a form of publication but as a form of community building, would those imprints have survived? After I signed the contract, I notified Stallman that the book project was back on. I mentioned the choice O\'Reilly was giving me between the Open Publication License and the GNU Free Documentation License. I told him I was leaning toward the OPL, if only for the fact I saw no reason to give O\'Reilly\'s competitors a chance to print the same book under a different cover. Stallman wrote back, arguing in favor of the GFDL, noting that O\'Reilly had already used it several times in the past. Despite the events of the past year, I suggested a deal. I would choose the GFDL if it gave me the possibility to do more interviews and if Stallman agreed to help O\'Reilly publicize the book. Stallman agreed to participate in more interviews but said that his participation in publicity-related events would depend on the content of the book. Viewing this as only fair, I set up an interview for December 17, 2001 in Cambridge. I set up the interview to coincide with a business trip my wife Tracy was taking to Boston. Two days before leaving, Tracy suggested I invite Stallman out to dinner. \"After all,\" she said, \"he is the one who brought us together.\" I sent an email to Stallman, who promptly sent a return email accepting the offer. When I drove up to Boston the next day, I met Tracy at her hotel and hopped the T to head over to MIT. When we got to Tech Square, I found Stallman in the middle of a conversation just as we knocked on the door. \"I hope you don\'t mind,\" he said, pulling the door open far enough so that Tracy and I could just barely hear Stallman\'s conversational counterpart. It was a youngish woman, mid-20s I\'d say, named Sarah. \"I took the liberty of inviting somebody else to have dinner with us,\" Stallman said, matter-of-factly, giving me the same cat-like smile he gave me back in that Palo Alto restaurant. To be honest, I wasn\'t too surprised. The news that Stallman had a new female friend had reached me a few weeks before, courtesy of Stallman\'s mother. \"In fact, they both went to Japan last month when Richard went over to accept the Takeda Award,\" Lippman told me at the time.Alas, I didn\'t find out about the Takeda Foundation\'s decision to award Stallman, along with Linus Torvalds and Ken Sakamura, with its first-ever award for \"Techno-Entrepreneurial Achievement for Social/Economic Well-Being\" until after Stallman had made the trip to Japan to accept the award. For more information about the award and its accompanying $1 million prize, visit the Takeda site, http://www.takeda-foundation.jp/. On the way over to the restaurant, I learned the circumstances of Sarah and Richard\'s first meeting. Interestingly, the circumstances were very familiar. Working on her own fictional book, Sarah said she heard about Stallman and what an interesting character he was. She promptly decided to create a character in her book on Stallman and, in the interests of researching the character, set up an interview with Stallman. Things quickly went from there. The two had been dating since the beginning of 2001, she said. \"I really admired the way Richard built up an entire political movement to address an issue of profound personal concern,\" Sarah said, explaining her attraction to Stallman. My wife immediately threw back the question: \"What was the issue?\" \"Crushing loneliness.\" During dinner, I let the women do the talking and spent most of the time trying to detect clues as to whether the last 12 months had softened Stallman in any significant way. I didn\'t see anything to suggest they had. Although more flirtatious than I remembered-a flirtatiousness spoiled somewhat by the number of times Stallman\'s eyes seemed to fixate on my wife\'s chest-Stallman retained the same general level of prickliness. At one point, my wife uttered an emphatic \"God forbid\" only to receive a typical Stallman rebuke. \"I hate to break it to you, but there is no God,\" Stallman said. Afterwards, when the dinner was complete and Sarah had departed, Stallman seemed to let his guard down a little. As we walked to a nearby bookstore, he admitted that the last 12 months had dramatically changed his outlook on life. \"I thought I was going to be alone forever,\" he said. \"I\'m glad I was wrong.\" Before parting, Stallman handed me his \"pleasure card,\" a business card listing Stallman\'s address, phone number, and favorite pastimes (\"sharing good books, good food and exotic music and dance\") so that I might set up a final interview. <Graphic file:/home/craigm/books/free_ep10.png> Stallman\'s \"pleasure\" card, handed to me the night of our dinner. The next day, over another meal of dim sum, Stallman seemed even more lovestruck than the night before. Recalling his debates with Currier House dorm maters over the benefits and drawbacks of an immortality serum, Stallman expressed hope that scientists might some day come up with the key to immortality. \"Now that I\'m finally starting to have happiness in my life, I want to have more,\" he said. When I mentioned Sarah\'s \"crushing loneliness\" comment, Stallman failed to see a connection between loneliness on a physical or spiritual level and loneliness on a hacker level. \"The impulse to share code is about friendship but friendship at a much lower level,\" he said. Later, however, when the subject came up again, Stallman did admit that loneliness, or the fear of perpetual loneliness, had played a major role in fueling his determination during the earliest days of the GNU Project. \"My fascination with computers was not a consequence of anything else,\" he said. \"I wouldn\'t have been less fascinated with computers if I had been popular and all the women flocked to me. However, it\'s certainly true the experience of feeling I didn\'t have a home, finding one and losing it, finding another and having it destroyed, affected me deeply. The one I lost was the dorm. The one that was destroyed was the AI Lab. The precariousness of not having any kind of home or community was very powerful. It made me want to fight to get it back.\" After the interview, I couldn\'t help but feel a certain sense of emotional symmetry. Hearing Sarah describe what attracted her to Stallman and hearing Stallman himself describe the emotions that prompted him to take up the free software cause, I was reminded of my own reasons for writing this book. Since July, 2000, I have learned to appreciate both the seductive and the repellent sides of the Richard Stallman persona. Like Eben Moglen before me, I feel that dismissing that persona as epiphenomenal or distracting in relation to the overall free software movement would be a grievous mistake. In many ways the two are so mutually defining as to be indistinguishable. While I\'m sure not every reader feels the same level of affinity for Stallman-indeed, after reading this book, some might feel zero affinity-I\'m sure most will agree. Few individuals offer as singular a human portrait as Richard M. Stallman. It is my sincere hope that, with this initial portrait complete and with the help of the GFDL, others will feel a similar urge to add their own perspective to that portrait. Appendix A : Terminology For the most part, I have chosen to use the term GNU/Linux in reference to the free software operating system and Linux when referring specifically to the kernel that drives the operating system. The most notable exception to this rule comes in Chapter 9 . In the final part of that chapter, I describe the early evolution of Linux as an offshoot of Minix. It is safe to say that during the first two years of the project\'s development, the operating system Torvalds and his colleagues were working on bore little similarity to the GNU system envisioned by Stallman, even though it gradually began to share key components, such as the GNU C Compiler and the GNU Debugger. This decision further benefits from the fact that, prior to 1993, Stallman saw little need to insist on credit. Some might view the decision to use GNU/Linux for later versions of the same operating system as arbitrary. I would like to point out that it was in no way a prerequisite for gaining Stallman\'s cooperation in the making of this book. I came to it of my own accord, partly because of the operating system\'s modular nature and the community surrounding it, and partly because of the apolitical nature of the Linux name. Given that this is a biography of Richard Stallman, it seemed inappropriate to define the operating system in apolitical terms. In the final phases of the book, when it became clear that O\'Reilly & Associates would be the book\'s publisher, Stallman did make it a condition that I use \"GNU/Linux\" instead of Linux if O\'Reilly expected him to provide promotional support for the book after publication. When informed of this, I relayed my earlier decision and left it up to Stallman to judge whether the resulting book met this condition or not. At the time of this writing, I have no idea what Stallman\'s judgment will be. A similar situation surrounds the terms \"free software\" and \"open source.\" Again, I have opted for the more politically laden \"free software\" term when describing software programs that come with freely copyable and freely modifiable source code. Although more popular, I have chosen to use the term \"open source\" only when referring to groups and businesses that have championed its usage. But for a few instances, the terms are completely interchangeable, and in making this decision I have followed the advice of Christine Peterson, the person generally credited with coining the term. \"The `free software\' term should still be used in circumstances where it works better,\" Peterson writes. \"[`Open source\'] caught on mainly because a new term was greatly needed, not because it\'s ideal.\" Appendix B Hack, Hackers, and Hacking To understand the full meaning of the word \" hacker,\" it helps to examine the word\'s etymology over the years. The New Hacker Dictionary , an online compendium of software-programmer jargon, officially lists nine different connotations of the word \"hack\" and a similar number for \"hacker.\" Then again, the same publication also includes an accompanying essay that quotes Phil Agre, an MIT hacker who warns readers not to be fooled by the word\'s perceived flexibility. \"Hack has only one meaning,\" argues Agre. \"An extremely subtle and profound one which defies articulation.\" Regardless of the width or narrowness of the definition, most modern hackers trace the word back to MIT, where the term bubbled up as popular item of student jargon in the early 1950s. In 1990 the MIT Museum put together a journal documenting the hacking phenomenon. According to the journal, students who attended the institute during the fifties used the word \"hack\" the way a modern student might use the word \"goof.\" Hanging a jalopy out a dormitory window was a \"hack,\" but anything harsh or malicious-e.g., egging a rival dorm\'s windows or defacing a campus statue-fell outside the bounds. Implicit within the definition of \"hack\" was a spirit of harmless, creative fun. This spirit would inspire the word\'s gerund form: \"hacking.\" A 1950s student who spent the better part of the afternoon talking on the phone or dismantling a radio might describe the activity as \"hacking.\" Again, a modern speaker would substitute the verb form of \"goof\"-\"goofing\" or \"goofing off\"-to describe the same activity. As the 1950s progressed, the word \"hack\" acquired a sharper, more rebellious edge. The MIT of the 1950s was overly competitive, and hacking emerged as both a reaction to and extension of that competitive culture. Goofs and pranks suddenly became a way to blow off steam, thumb one\'s nose at campus administration, and indulge creative thinking and behavior stifled by the Institute\'s rigorous undergraduate curriculum. With its myriad hallways and underground steam tunnels, the Institute offered plenty of exploration opportunities for the student undaunted by locked doors and \"No Trespassing\" signs. Students began to refer to their off-limits explorations as \"tunnel hacking.\" Above ground, the campus phone system offered similar opportunities. Through casual experimentation and due diligence, students learned how to perform humorous tricks. Drawing inspiration from the more traditional pursuit of tunnel hacking, students quickly dubbed this new activity \"phone hacking.\" The combined emphasis on creative play and restriction-free exploration would serve as the basis for the future mutations of the hacking term. The first self-described computer hackers of the 1960s MIT campus originated from a late 1950s student group called the Tech Model Railroad Club. A tight clique within the club was the Signals and Power (S&P) Committee-the group behind the railroad club\'s electrical circuitry system. The system was a sophisticated assortment of relays and switches similar to the kind that controlled the local campus phone system. To control it, a member of the group simply dialed in commands via a connected phone and watched the trains do his bidding. The nascent electrical engineers responsible for building and maintaining this system saw their activity as similar in spirit to phone hacking. Adopting the hacking term, they began refining it even further. From the S&P hacker point of view, using one less relay to operate a particular stretch of track meant having one more relay for future play. Hacking subtly shifted from a synonym for idle play to a synonym for idle play that improved the overall performance or efficiency of the club\'s railroad system at the same time. Soon S&P committee members proudly referred to the entire activity of improving and reshaping the track\'s underlying circuitry as \"hacking\" and to the people who did it as \"hackers.\" Given their affinity for sophisticated electronics-not to mention the traditional MIT-student disregard for closed doors and \"No Trespassing\" signs-it didn\'t take long before the hackers caught wind of a new machine on campus. Dubbed the TX-0, the machine was one of the first commercially marketed computers. By the end of the 1950s, the entire S&P clique had migrated en masse over to the TX-0 control room, bringing the spirit of creative play with them. The wide-open realm of computer programming would encourage yet another mutation in etymology. \"To hack\" no longer meant soldering unusual looking circuits, but cobbling together software programs with little regard to \"official\" methods or software-writing procedures. It also meant improving the efficiency and speed of already-existing programs that tended to hog up machine resources. True to the word\'s roots, it also meant writing programs that served no other purpose than to amuse or entertain. A classic example of this expanded hacking definition is the game Spacewar, the first interactive video game. Developed by MIT hackers in the early 1960s, Spacewar had all the traditional hacking definitions: it was goofy and random, serving little useful purpose other than providing a nightly distraction for the dozen or so hackers who delighted in playing it. From a software perspective, however, it was a monumental testament to innovation of programming skill. It was also completely free. Because hackers had built it for fun, they saw no reason to guard their creation, sharing it extensively with other programmers. By the end of the 1960s, Spacewar had become a favorite diversion for mainframe programmers around the world. This notion of collective innovation and communal software ownership distanced the act of computer hacking in the 1960s from the tunnel hacking and phone hacking of the 1950s. The latter pursuits tended to be solo or small-group activities. Tunnel and phone hackers relied heavily on campus lore, but the off-limits nature of their activity discouraged the open circulation of new discoveries. Computer hackers, on the other hand, did their work amid a scientific field biased toward collaboration and the rewarding of innovation. Hackers and \"official\" computer scientists weren\'t always the best of allies, but in the rapid evolution of the field, the two species of computer programmer evolved a cooperative-some might say symbiotic-relationship. It is a testament to the original computer hackers\' prodigious skill that later programmers, including Richard M. Stallman, aspired to wear the same hacker mantle. By the mid to late 1970s, the term \"hacker\" had acquired elite connotations. In a general sense, a computer hacker was any person who wrote software code for the sake of writing software code. In the particular sense, however, it was a testament to programming skill. Like the term \"artist,\" the meaning carried tribal overtones. To describe a fellow programmer as hacker was a sign of respect. To describe oneself as a hacker was a sign of immense personal confidence. Either way, the original looseness of the computer-hacker appellation diminished as computers became more common. As the definition tightened, \"computer\" hacking acquired additional semantic overtones. To be a hacker, a person had to do more than write interesting software; a person had to belong to the hacker \"culture\" and honor its traditions the same way a medieval wine maker might pledge membership to a vintners\' guild. The social structure wasn\'t as rigidly outlined as that of a guild, but hackers at elite institutions such as MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon began to speak openly of a \"hacker ethic\": the yet-unwritten rules that governed a hacker\'s day-to-day behavior. In the 1984 book Hackers, author Steven Levy, after much research and consultation, codified the hacker ethic as five core hacker tenets. In many ways, the core tenets listed by Levy continue to define the culture of computer hacking. Still, the guild-like image of the hacker community was undermined by the overwhelmingly populist bias of the software industry. By the early 1980s, computers were popping up everywhere, and programmers who once would have had to travel to top-rank institutions or businesses just to gain access to a machine suddenly had the ability to rub elbows with major-league hackers via the ARPAnet. The more these programmers rubbed elbows, the more they began to appropriate the anarchic philosophies of the hacker culture in places like MIT. Lost within the cultural transfer, however, was the native MIT cultural taboo against malicious behavior. As younger programmers began employing their computer skills to harmful ends-creating and disseminating computer viruses, breaking into military computer systems, deliberately causing machines such as MIT Oz, a popular ARPAnet gateway, to crash-the term \"hacker\" acquired a punk, nihilistic edge. When police and businesses began tracing computer-related crimes back to a few renegade programmers who cited convenient portions of the hacking ethic in defense of their activities, the word \"hacker\" began appearing in newspapers and magazine stories in a negative light. Although books like Hackers did much to document the original spirit of exploration that gave rise to the hacking culture, for most news reporters, \"computer hacker\" became a synonym for \"electronic burglar.\" Although hackers have railed against this perceived misusage for nearly two decades, the term\'s rebellious connotations dating back to the 1950s make it hard to discern the 15-year-old writing software programs that circumvent modern encryption programs from the 1960s college student, picking locks and battering down doors to gain access to the lone, office computer terminal. One person\'s creative subversion of authority is another person\'s security headache, after all. Even so, the central taboo against malicious or deliberately harmful behavior remains strong enough that most hackers prefer to use the term \" cracker\"-i.e., a person who deliberately cracks a computer security system to steal or vandalize data-to describe the subset of hackers who apply their computing skills maliciously. This central taboo against maliciousness remains the primary cultural link between the notion of hacking in the early 21st century and hacking in the 1950s. It is important to note that, as the idea of computer hacking has evolved over the last four decades, the original notion of hacking-i.e., performing pranks or exploring underground tunnels-remains intact. In the fall of 2000, the MIT Museum paid tradition to the Institute\'s age-old hacking tradition with a dedicated exhibit, the Hall of Hacks. The exhibit includes a number of photographs dating back to the 1920s, including one involving a mock police cruiser. In 1993, students paid homage to the original MIT notion of hacking by placing the same police cruiser, lights flashing, atop the Institute\'s main dome. The cruiser\'s vanity license plate read IHTFP, a popular MIT acronym with many meanings. The most noteworthy version, itself dating back to the pressure-filled world of MIT student life in the 1950s, is \"I hate this fucking place.\" In 1990, however, the Museum used the acronym as a basis for a journal on the history of hacks. Titled, The Institute for Hacks Tomfoolery and Pranks, the journal offers an adept summary of the hacking. \"In the culture of hacking, an elegant, simple creation is as highly valued as it is in pure science,\" writes Boston Globe reporter Randolph Ryan in a 1993 article attached to the police car exhibit. \"A Hack differs from the ordinary college prank in that the event usually requires careful planning, engineering and finesse, and has an underlying wit and inventiveness,\" Ryan writes. \"The unwritten rule holds that a hack should be good-natured, non-destructive and safe. In fact, hackers sometimes assist in dismantling their own handiwork.\" The urge to confine the culture of computer hacking within the same ethical boundaries is well-meaning but impossible. Although most software hacks aspire to the same spirit of elegance and simplicity, the software medium offers less chance for reversibility. Dismantling a police cruiser is easy compared with dismantling an idea, especially an idea whose time has come. Hence the growing distinction between \"black hat\" and \"white hat\"-i.e., hackers who turn new ideas toward destructive, malicious ends versus hackers who turn new ideas toward positive or, at the very least, informative ends. Once a vague item of obscure student jargon, the word \"hacker\" has become a linguistic billiard ball, subject to political spin and ethical nuances. Perhaps this is why so many hackers and journalists enjoy using it. Where that ball bounces next, however, is anybody\'s guess.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft,\" which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you.\" A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\'s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque.\" ');

Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\'s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document\'s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 1. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. 2. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). 3. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 4. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 5. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 6. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 7. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\'s license notice. 8. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 9. Preserve the section entitled \"History,\" and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 10. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 11. In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications,\" preserve the section\'s title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 12. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 13. Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements.\" Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 14. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\'s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section entitled \"Endorsements,\" provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements,\" and any sections entitled \"Dedications.\" You must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\" COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate,\" and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document\'s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to Use This License for Your Documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\". If you have no Invariant Sections, write \"with no Invariant Sections\" instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write \"no Front-Cover Texts\" instead of \"Front-Cover Texts being LIST\"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

Medicinal Plants of the Philippine Archipelago The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines By T. H. Pardo De Tavera Doctor en Medicina de la Facultad de Paris, Comisionado Cientifico de S. M. en las Islas Filipinas y Delegado General en las Mismas de la Société Académique Indo-Chinoise de Francia, Miembro Fundador Correspondiente de la Sociedad Española de Higiene, Etc. Translated and Revised by Jerome B. Thomas, Jr., A.B., M.D. Captain and Assistant Surgeon, U. S. V. Philadelphia: P. Blakiston’s Son & Co. 1012 Walnut Street. 1901 Copyright, 1901, by P. Blakiston’s Son & Co. Translator’s Preface. This translation was undertaken with the especial object of facilitating the study of the native medicinal plants by the numerous medical officers stationed at small posts throughout the Philippines. In order to aid in the recognition of these plants, the botanical descriptions have been revised to the extent of adding, where possible, the size and shape of the plant, English name, length of leaves, color of flowers, etc., in many instances supplying the entire botanical description where it had been omitted on account of general familiarity with the plant. Comparing the few analyses that I have had an opportunity to make with corresponding ones in the native works from which Dr. Tavera has taken his botanical descriptions, I am impressed with the necessity for a revision of the Botany of the Philippines. However, as the therapeutic properties of the flora are of foremost interest to the medical profession I have not hesitated to publish the book in its present form as an entering wedge, leaving to those better fitted the great work of classifying the flora of these islands in accordance with modern botanical science. Dr. Tavera has faithfully described the Malay and Hindu therapeutics of the present day, enriching his description by observations founded on a long practice in Paris and in his own native Luzon. From this potpourri of scientific therapeutics and ignorant, superstitious drugging the interested physician will elicit not a few useful data concerning the treatment of disease in the tropics, and at the same time gain a more intimate knowledge of both the people and plants of our new Asiatic possessions. I take this occasion to gratefully acknowledge my obligations to Mr. A. P. Tonielli, stenographer and translator of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, for typewriting the manuscript of this translation. Jerome B. Thomas, Jr. Manila, P. I. Preface. Commissioned by His Majesty’s Government to study the medicinal plants of my native country, I returned there and spent two years in collecting data regarding the use that the Filipinos make of their plants in the treatment of disease. At the same time I collected and carefully preserved some with the purpose of taking them to Europe, to study their chemical composition in the laboratories of Paris under the direction of the eminent men who had been my instructors in medicine. The work I did in the Philippines was preliminary, a preparation for the more extended study of the subject which I wished to make in Paris, where I went with my notes and collection. Unfortunately, upon leaving Manila, I confided the mounting and pressing of my plants to an inexperienced person who stupidly placed in the midst of them several succulent tubers which decomposed during the voyage and spoiled the other plants. At the same time I received in Paris an important collection of the vegetable drugs of the Philippines, sent by my friend the pharmacist, M. Rosedo Garcia, and destined for the World’s Fair of 1889. I opened with great pleasure the wood and zinc box in which the collection came, anticipating that I should be able to carry out my plan of study and at the same time win for my friend, Garcia, a well-deserved premium. Imagine my disappointment upon finding that, by an unfortunate coincidence, his plants had arrived in the same condition as mine, having also been packed with tubers of ubi, gabi, etc., and several cocoanuts which had decomposed. Many times since then I have tried to obtain from Manila, through exchange or payment of money, a similar collection, but have been unable to secure a single leaf of the plants I so desired. If in the future I have the good fortune to procure any, I shall make a study of those at hand and publish the results. I herewith publish the results of my investigations and experiments in Manila, where, especially in the neighboring towns of San Mateo and San Miguel, I often had opportunities for using, with good results, the plants of which this volume treats. I may add that in spite of the limited means at my disposal in Manila and the short time left me by my regular occupations I was able to conduct a few laboratory experiments owing to which this work contains some personal observations reinforcing those quoted from medical literature. The flora of the Archipelago is known to-day through the works of Fathers Blanco, Llanos, Fernandez del Villar and Naves, and of the engineers Jordano, the brothers Vidal and Soler and others who have brought such honor to Spanish science, preparing the way for the study of the therapeutic and industrial applications of that wonderfully rich plant life with which our islands have been endowed. Their works help us to recognize the plants whose medicinal virtues are herein described and it is to them I owe the botanical descriptions in this treatise. Father Blanco, in describing certain plants, mentions their medicinal uses in the Philippines, but his descriptions are few and very deficient as one would expect in a work of the scope of his Flora. A Jesuit of some reputation, Father Clain, published in Manila in 1712 a book entitled “Remedios fáciles para diferentes enfermedades?” in which he speaks of the medicinal virtues of some of the indigenous plants, almost the same ones that appear in another work, a frank and pleasing little treatise written by Father Santa Maria. Father Mercado is the only one who has written a special treatise on the subject and his manuscript remained unedited until the Augustinian Fathers of Manila published it in the last edition of Father Blanco’s “Flora”; but neither this work nor those of Clain or Santa Maria are useful to a physician, nor are they as accurately written as works of a scientific character should be. From time to time superficial articles have appeared in the Manila papers regarding the virtues of some plant or other and these books and articles comprise the whole literature on the subject up to this time. Some physicians regard with small favor the therapeutic application of plants by the Filipino “herb-doctors” (curanderos) as being entirely empirical. This disparagement is unjustified because in all the most rational and scientific remedies that we make use of, the first step towards the final development of their relative position among remedies is due to empiricism which is founded on daily experience, on observation of results obtained in specific cases, facts that are handed down from father to son for generations. The scientific explanation is lacking, but those first ideas frequently owing their origin to chance, or, perhaps, to superstition, have often been based upon the observation of facts which, although fortuitous, are none the less positive. Many of the plants mentioned in this book are official in the Pharmacopœia of India and we see no reason why their use should be proscribed in the Philippines. Filipino physicians not only can but should employ many indigenous plants in their therapeutics; in many instances they would find them more useful than the exotics, which are not always fresh and are commonly reduced in strength by long keeping or damaged by some circumstance of voyage or climate. The price is another argument in favor of the use of native drugs. If the pharmacists would prepare extracts and keep on hand the crude drugs most in demand the public would gain a great advantage and the druggists be well repaid for their labor. Physicians and pharmacists will surely understand these advantages and when finally one considers that the patients generally prefer to be treated with native plants, I feel justified in the hope that their use will spread rapidly in the Philippines. To employ therapeutically the drugs described in this work is not to experiment “in anima vilis,” as some would have us believe. To experiment is to employ unknown remedies of unknown virtues and properties. In this treatise I am not attempting to fix the indications for this or that product, but simply make known the diseases in which the Filipinos and the natives of other countries employ the products. Any physician has a perfect right to prescribe these drugs, as have also the “curanderos” and even the laity, with this difference, however, that the physician is capable of observing results and guiding himself by the physiologic action of the drugs. His knowledge of the physiologic and anatomo-pathologic problems of the human body, will enable the physician to make scientific inferences that would be hidden from the common “curandero.” As neither the Manila nor the provincial physicians keep these medicinal plants in stock, with the exception of those that are official in the European and American pharmacopœias, it will be necessary for the physician who wishes to use them, to busy himself with seeking them and laying in a sufficient stock to serve him when the opportunity presents itself. It is necessary to preserve them by drying and this is best done by exposing them several days to the fresh air in a dry place—for example, the corridors of the house—being careful not to expose them to the rays of the sun, in which latter event the fleshy and juicy plants which do not desiccate rapidly, putrefy or ferment. A convenient way to get them is to visit the Binondo Square where there has been market for native drugs from time immemorial. The gardeners from the neighboring towns, especially those from Pasay and Singalon, regularly offer the plants for sale and will undertake to supply you with any that may not be on hand. Inasmuch as the common names of the plants lead to many mistakes and much confusion, it is indispensable to acquaint one’s self with the description of the plant and be sure that the actual product conforms in all respects to the description. For this purpose it is well to obtain flowering specimens, and bearing this fact in mind I have been careful to indicate the flowering season of each plant. By making excursions to the towns of San Mateo and Angono I have obtained an abundance of whatever I sought and at the same time have learned by talking with the mountaineers and “curanderos,” what uses they make of their plants. The “curanderos” know a great deal concerning these uses, but become very reticent as soon as they are questioned about them. Whether it is dread of ridicule or selfishness or fear that silences them, the fact remains that it is no easy matter to glean any useful facts from them. And yet by tact and friendliness one may elicit much more information from them than first impressions would lead one to hope. Leaves should be gathered when fully developed, rejecting the old, dried and worm-eaten ones. The best time to gather bark is one month before the period of inflorescence, when it is rich in sap. The flowers are best gathered when about half expanded. The fruit is gathered green or ripe according to the active principle sought. The seeds should always be mature. Not all parts of the plant are equally provided with the active principle which may be localized in the root or the flower; or distinct principles may exist in different parts of the same plant. Therefore the part indicated, and only that part, should be employed. In the root the active substance usually resides in the bark, sometimes in the parenchyma that envelopes the woody tissue and rarely in the woody tissue itself, as, for example, in “rhubarb” and “pareira brava.” The stem bark is also a frequent seat of the active principle, of which the outer portion contains the greater amount, according to the valuable experiments of Howard. Some plants owe their therapeutic importance to their wood, others to their leaves or flowers, and regarding the localization of the active principle in these parts we have nothing especial to indicate. The fruit, however, may have a pericarp consisting of mucilage, starch, sugar and gum, etc., while the seeds contain fatty matter, fixed or essential oils or alkaloids, as is the case with coffee and cacao. In view of these facts, we repeat that it is indispensable to use that part of each plant which I have indicated as applicable to a determined case or condition. I earnestly hope that the physicians and pharmacists practising in the Philippines may undertake investigations and experiments regarding the therapeutic properties of the plants of my native land, and that my endeavors may have acted as a stimulus or inspiration to the loyal and earnest study of the subjects that are now awakening such interest, not only in Europe and America, but in India and Japan. I should be pleased to receive notes, plants or reports of researches from any one interested in the subject matter of this book, and I shall consider it a pleasure, as well as a duty, to devote my forces, small as they may be, to aiding any one who may do me the honor to claim my assistance.

(11, 2, '5782616312652043896_26393-h-1.htm', 2, ' The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines Medicinal Plants of the Philippines Dicotyledonous, Polypetalous. Dilleniaceæ. Tetracera macrophylla, Vall. (T. monocarpa, T. sarmentosa, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Malakatmón, Tag. Uses.—The wood of malakatmón is one of the best known and popular drugs of the Binondo1 market place. It is used as an infusion internally in the hæmoptysis of consumptives, and externally in the treatment of sore throat, its action being due to the large amount of tannin it contains. It is also employed in Malabar in the form of an infusion of the leaves of the species, T. Rheedi, to treat sore throat, mixing it with a decoction of rice called cange. The Filipinos do not distinguish this species from the T. Assa. Both are called malakatmón, and are employed indiscriminately to accomplish the same results. The silicious concretion obtained from the leaves is used as a polish in the form of polish paper. Dose.—In infusion for internal use, 4 grams of wood to 1 liter of water; as a gargle, 10 to 15 grams to the liter. Botanical Description.—A shrub with leaves alternate, oval, serrate, finely dentate with very short and stiff hairs. Flowers of a strong, rather agreeable odor, axillary, in panicles. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 petals. Stamens indefinite, expanding at the upper end and bearing 2 anthers. Carpels 3, with ovules indefinite in two series. Seeds with red arils. Habitat.—In the vicinity of Manila. Blooms in July. Magnoliaceæ Magnolia Family. Illicium anisatum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Anis estrellado, Badiana, Sp.; Sag̃ki, Tag.; Star Anise, Eng. Uses.—Although this plant does not grow in the Philippines, the use of its fruit is so common there that it demands a place in this work. It is employed chiefly as a condiment in the preparation of food, and its essential oil is used to prepare the native “anise cordial” by mixing it with alcohol obtained from the palm or from sugar cane. The decoction of the fruit is given after meals as a tea-like beverage, to aid digestion or for its carminative effect in flatulent colic. Star anise has an aromatic taste, slightly bitter and acrid, and a very marked perfume of anise which with its star-like form gives the plant one of its names. It is a very useful stimulant, tonic, stomachic and carminative. It is official in all Pharmacopœias and the pericarp is the part employed. The dose is from 1 to 2 grams to 100 of water in infusion, to be taken in one draught. According to Schlegel it contains the following substances: An essential oil 4.675; a green waxy material which melts at 51°, a resin, a gum and saponin. The essential oil is (almost) identical with that of anise from which it is impossible to distinguish it chemically. The only difference is that the former has a blander odor and solidifies at 1°.25 instead of 10°, as does the oil of anise. Botanical Description.—The plant grows in the mountains of Yunnan, China, and in Tonquin. The part used in the Philippines is the fruit, being indeed the only part known here. This is composed of 8 woody follicles arranged about a central column in the form of a star. These follicles open at maturity and reveal the seeds, which are shining, smooth, ovoid, hard, of a pretty chestnut-red color. In the Philippines they are sold even in the smallest food-vending shops. Michelia Champaca, L. Nom. Vulg.—Tsampaka, Sampaka, Tag.; Champaca, Fil.-Span. Uses.—The bark of the trunk is well known as a febrifuge and emmenagogue in India. It is slightly bitter and aromatic. Dr. H. Folliat has used it with success in the Island of Mauritius in the treatment of the common intermittent fevers; he administered the infusion (bark 30 grams, water 600 cc.)—or the decoction (bark 30 grams, water 1,200 cc.); boil till reduced to 600 cc.—giving a wine-glassful every hour just before and after the paroxysm. An astringent decoction made from the leaves is used as a gargle in sore throat. The root is emmenagogue and the seeds are used in the treatment of anal fissure. Dr. Hooper has found the following substances in the bark of the Champana: a volatile oil with a pine-like odor; a fixed oil, insoluble in alcohol, melting at 15° and forming soap with soda; a resin extremely bitter, acrid, brown in color; tannin; sugar; a bitter principle, albuminoids, coloring matters, mucilage and starch. Botanical Description.—A tree 15–18° high; leaves alternate, 6 × 2′, stipulate, simple. Flowers fragrant, saffron-colored, hermaphrodite, solitary and axillary. The receptacle, conical at its base, becomes narrow, lengthens and then enlarges, forming a column which is bare at its narrow part. At its base is inserted the perianth composed of 6 overlapping leaflets arranged in two series. Stamens indefinite, fixed in the base of the column of the receptacle on the superior portion of which are inserted the ovaries which contain many ovules arranged in two vertical series. Habitat.—Common in all parts (of the islands). Anonaceæ. Custard-Apple Family. Artabotrys odoratissimus, R. Br. (A. hamatus, Bl.; Uvaria Sinensis and Unona uncinata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Ilag̃-ilag̃ de China, Sp.-Fil.; Alag̃-ilag̃ Son-son, Tag. Uses.—A decoction of the leaves of this species is used to treat cholera in some of the islands of the Malay group; in the island of Java they use for the same purpose a decoction of the leaves of the species A. suaveolens, Bl., which is commonly called Susog̃ Damulog in the Pampanga dialect. The active principles of these plants are so powerful that one must beware of giving a large dose, as hemorrhages, nervous phenomena and abortion may follow. Botanical Description.—A tree 15–18° high with leaves alternate, lanceolate, glabrous, and petioles very short. Flowers very sweet, axillary, solitary. Petals 6, fleshy, concave at the base. Stamens indefinite, closely packed, overlapping. Peduncle curved like a crook. Habitat.—Cultivated in gardens. Anona squamosa, L. (A. tuberosa, Rumph.) Nom. Vulg.—Ates, Tag.; Custard Apple, Eng. Uses.—The fruit of the mature ates is edible and is one of the most delicious that grows in the Philippines; its white and delicately perfumed pulp has a delicious flavor. The unripe fruit is exceedingly astringent. The fermented juice of the ripe pulp is used in certain parts of America to prepare a popular drink. The powdered seeds make a useful parasiticide especially when used on the scalp, but it is necessary to avoid getting any of the drug in the eyes on account of its irritant effect. Botanical Description.—Tree 8 or 9° high with leaves alternate, oblong, the edges pubescent. Flowers greenish-yellow, axillary, solitary; peduncle not curved. Petals 6, convergent. Stamens crowded, indefinite. Fruit fleshy, covered with scales or rather rounded tubercles; beneath is the white and fragment pulp, covering the long-oval seeds. A. reticulate, L. Nom. Vulg.—Anonas, Sp.-Fil. Uses.—The fruit of this species is neither as much prized nor as abundant in the Philippines as that of the ates. When unripe it possesses the same properties as the latter. The large proportion of tannin which both species contain in their unripe state, makes them very useful in treating diarrhœa and dysentery. They are administered in the form of a decoction, by enema. The sap of the trunk is very irritating. The roots are used by the American Indians to treat epilepsy. Lemon juice is the antidote for the sap of this species. I wish to call attention to the similarity of the common name of this plant to another entirely distinct species commonly used in the Tagalo therapeutics; namely, the anonag̃ (Cordia), with which it must not be confused. Botanical Description.—Tree 10° high with leaves lanceolate, pubescent. Flowers in a sort of umbel. Corolla like that of A. squamosa. Fruit without the plainly visible tubercles of the foregoing species, their presence being merely suggested by a sort of net traced on the surface. A. muricata, L. Nom. Vulg.—Guanábano, Goyabano, Sp.-Fil. Uses.—The ripe fruit possesses antiscorbutic properties; the unripe fruit is used in treating dysentery. It is said that the ripe fruit is used in diseases of the liver. Botanical Description.—Tree with leaves oval, alternate and glabrous. Flower solitary, terminal, whitish. The fruit is much larger than that of the other species, is covered with scales that end in a soft point or thorn and has a very pronounced acid taste. Habitat.—All three species are common in all parts of the Archipelago. Menispermaceæ. Moonseed Family. Tinospora crispa, Miers. (Menispermum crispum, L.; M. rimosum, Blanco; Cocculus crispus, DC.) Nom. Vulg.—Makabuhay, Tag. Uses.—Makabuhay is one of the most widely known and used plants in the Philippines; a sort of panacea applied to all bodily afflictions. Its Tagalo name means literally “you may live.” A shoot deprived of roots and dropped in some moist place is soon covered with bright green leaves and adventitious roots. This peculiarity of the plant made it possible for me to take a large number of sprouts from Manila to Paris where they arrived perfectly fresh after a voyage of forty days, during which they lay almost forgotten in the ship and the cars. The stem is the part employed in medicine. A decoction is given internally in the various forms of malarial fever and of dyspepsia. Externally it is most useful as a wash for ulcers of all kinds, rapidly improving their appearance. In India the species T. cordifolia is used; it differs but little from T. crispa. It is official in the Pharmacopœia and has been introduced into Europe. T. cordifolia has given excellent results in the mild forms of intermittent fever; in general debility following long and severe cases of illness; in chronic rheumatism, and in the second stage of syphilis. As the two species are so much alike we shall add the preparations and dose of T. cordifolia which we have used on several occasions with good results. Tincture of T. cordifolia.—Stems of the dried plant, 100 grams. Alcohol 21° (Cartier), 500 cc. Macerate seven days in a closed vessel stirring from time to time. After decanting add enough alcohol (21°) to bring the quantity up to 500 cc., and filter. Dose.—4–8 grams. Maceration.—Fresh stems cut in small pieces, 30 grams, water 300 grams. Macerate for two hours and filter. Dose.—30–90 cc. a day. Extract.—Dry makabuhay in small pieces 500 grams. Water 2½ liters. Macerate for twelve hours, filter the liquid and express the macerated drug which is then macerated a second time in 2½ liters of water. Express again, unite the two liquids and filter. Evaporate in a water-bath to the consistency of a pill mass. Dose.—½–1½ grams a day in fractional doses. Botanical Description.—A vine whose runners entwine themselves among the tops of the highest trees, giving off many adventitious roots which seek the earth. The stem is covered with projecting tubercles. Leaves heart-shaped, pointed, entire with five well-marked nerves. Flowers yellowish-green, diœcious, growing in axillary racemes. The male flowers have a corolla of six petals, the three smaller ones arranged alternately. In the female flower the stamens are represented by three glands situated at the base of the petals. Fruit, an elliptical drupe. Anamirta Cocculus, Wight & Arn. (Menispermum Cocculus, (L.) Blanco; M. lacunosum, Famk; Cocculus lacunosus, C. suberosus, DC.) Nom. Vulg.—Laktag̃, Liktag̃, Suma, Lanta, Lintag̃ bagin, Tuba, Balasin, Bayati, Tag., Vis., Pam. Uses.—One of the uses to which the India berries (Cocas de Levante) are put in the Philippines, is to throw them into small sluggish streams or into lakes with the object of intoxicating the fish which soon come to the surface and float there as if dead. This custom is very extensive in Malaysia, in India and even in Europe, where, in order to avoid the cases of poisoning which this practice has occasioned in the consumers of fish taken in this way, it has been found necessary to forbid the sale of the berries except in the pharmacies. These restrictions are practiced in France. In the Binondo market in Manila the root of this plant may be found in abundance; it is yellow and very bitter. The natives use the infusion (5–10 grams to 300 cc. of water) in fevers, dyspepsia and menstrual derangements. In India also the root is used in the same complaints. The fruit contains the highly toxic principle picrotoxin, and others as follows: Menispermin (C18H24N2O2) is an alkaloid which crystallizes in pyramidal prisms, is soluble in alcohol and ether and insoluble in water. Hot nitric acid converts it into oxalic acid and a yellow substance of a resinous appearance. Picrotoxin (C30H24O13) is not an alkaloid as may be seen from its formula. Its properties are not well known at the present time. It crystallizes in small quadrilateral prisms, white and transparent, or in needles grouped in stars. No odor, taste bitter, insoluble in water, partly soluble in alcohol and in ether, freely soluble in acids and alkalies. A solution in concentrated sulphuric acid has a saffron-yellow color. Nitric acid transforms it into oxalic acid. Picrotoxinin exists in picrotoxin in the proportion of 32 to 100, and may be separated by boiling in benzine. It is bitter, poisonous, reduced by Fehling’s solution and nitrate of silver. Sixty-six per cent. of picrotoxin consists of another bitter substance, non-poisonous—picrotin, which is insoluble in benzine and is reduced by Fehling’s solution and nitrate of silver. Lastly, anamirtin is found in the mother water of picrotoxin; it is not bitter, not poisonous, and not reducible by the aforementioned reagents. The fruit of the anamirta, the “coca de Levante” is an acrid, narcotic poison, which may not be employed internally; its uses are limited to external medication. In the Pharmacopœia of India is given the formula for a parasiticide ointment, highly recommended in the treatment of pediculi: Unguentum anamirtæ: 4 grams Cocculus berries, powdered, 30 grams Vaseline. M. Fiat unguentum. In applying this ointment it is necessary to make sure that there is no wound or abrasion of the skin through which absorption might take place. Botanical Description.—A vine with leaves alternate, entire, glabrous, broadly oval, pointed, with 5 nerves which unite at the base, long petioles. Flowers diœcious, in compound racemes. Male flowers consist of a perianth without corolla, the sepals arranged by threes in two or three whorls. The end of the receptacle expanded like a bead, bears a large number of stamens in 6 vertical series, with anthers sessile and 4-lobed. Female flowers analogous as regards the perianth, with 6–9 sterile stamens. Carpels formed of 5 ovaries, free, unilocular, containing one ovule each. Fruit, a drupe of a purple color, the size of a filbert, kidney-shaped, the albumen horny. Cissampelos Pareira, L. Nom. Vulg.—Sansawsansawan, Tag.; Chinchaochinchauan, Sp.-Fil. Uses.—Although this plant formerly bore the Portuguese name of Pareira brava, the U. S. P. and B. P. recognize now under this title only the root of Chondrodendron tomentosum. It is diuretic and tonic and apparently exercises an astringent and sedative action upon the mucous membrane of the genito-urinary organs. The root is used in acute and chronic cystitis. In Brazil it is used as a diaphoretic and as such is employed in cases of venomous snake bites. It is also used there as an emmenagogue and diuretic, in intermittent fevers, dropsy and suppression of the lochia in women recently confined. It is official in the Pharmacopœia of India. Decoction.— Root of cissampelos, small pieces, 50 grams. Water 600 grams. Dose.—30–100 grams. Boil 15 minutes; filter and add enough water to bring the total bulk up to 600 cc. Extract.— Root of cissampelos in powder 500 grams. Water 5 liters. Dose.—.5–1 gram. Digest the powder for 24 hours in 500 cc. water, pour the mixture into a filter and add water gradually until the percolate amounts to 5 liters. Evaporate the percolate in a water-bath to the consistency of a pill mass. Fluid Extract.—This is prepared in the same manner as the extract and is allowed to remain in the bath until reduced in bulk to 400 grams. It is then removed and 100 grams of alcohol (36°) are added. Dose.—1.75–7 cc. Chemical Composition.—Flückiger has isolated a bitter principle analogous to berberin; also buxine and paracine, which latter received the name pelosine from Wiggers in 1839. The former chemist proposed the name buxine for all these analogous principles. Pelosine or buxine is precipitated by a concentrated solution of HCl, by sal ammoniac, by potassium nitrate and potassium iodide. He also discovered a neutral substance, deyamitin, which crystallizes in microscopic tablets; sulphuric acid added to these gives a pretty dark blue color which changes to green. Botanical Description.—A climbing shrub with cylindrical woody stem, with leaves simple, alternate, entire, petiolate, ovoid, broad at the base. The inferior surface of the leaf is pubescent, especially in the intervals between the ribs. Flowers diœcious, small, racemose. Calyx of 12 sepals arranged in 3 whorls, the inner ones broad and petaloid. Corolla of 6 petals arranged in 2 whorls. Stamens sterile or rudimentary in the pistillate flower, the staminate flower bearing 6; anthers innate, 2-celled. Drupes oval, 2 or 3 cm. long, black, closely resembling a grape seed. Nymphæaceæ. Water-Lily Family. Nymphæa Lotus, L. Nom. Vulg.—Lawas, Talaylo, Tunas, Gaway-gaway, Tag., Vis., Pam.; Water Lily, Eng. Uses.—The anaphrodisiac virtues attributed to this plant and to all the water-lily family are purely imaginary. Its juice being slightly bitter and astringent is used in decoction as an injection in gonorrhœa. It possesses mild narcotic properties, for which some use the juice of the whole plant, rubbing the forehead and temples with it to produce sleep. Botanical Description.—An aquatic plant, with leaves solitary, terminal, floating on the water, dentate, glabrous, broad, deeply cleft at the base, with a very long petiole. Flowers solitary, persistent in the ripe fruit, oval. Stamens indefinite in fine whorls or verticils. Habitat.—Common on the shores of the Laguna de Bay. Nelumbium nucifera, Gaertn. (N. speciosum, Willd.; N. Asiaticum, Rich.; Cyamus Nelumbo, Sm.; C. mysticus, Salis.) Nom. Vulg.—Bayno, Tag.; Sukaw, Iloc.; Sacred Lotus, Eng. Uses.—An infusion of the flowers is used internally in dysentery. In India they use, for diarrhœa and vomiting, the viscid juice obtained from the petioles and the peduncles of the flowers. The rootstock contains a large quantity of starch which has been utilized for food in the periods of famine which have desolated India and Egypt. This flower was the Sacred Lotus of the Egyptians and the people of India have dedicated it to Lakshmi, the goddess of health and prosperity. Infusion.— Petals, dried 5 grams. Water 250 grams. Sig. To be taken during 24 hours. Botanical Description.—An aquatic plant with fleshy rootstock which creeps along the muddy bottoms; from its nodes spring the stalks of the leaves and flowers. Its leaves are alternate, polymorphous, some above and some below the surface of the water, concave in the center whence ribs separate, shield-shaped. Petioles very long, bearing soft, short spines. The flowers white or pink, solitary; peduncle long and, like the petioles, covered with soft, short spines. Calyx of 4–5 unequal sepals, imbricated. Corolla with an indefinite number of unequal petals, the inner ones shorter. Stamens indefinite, inserted in the base of the receptacle. Receptacle expanded above the andrœcium, in the form of an inverted cone, containing a large number of alveoli with circular openings. Papaveraceæ. Poppy Family. Argemone Mexicana, L. Nom. Vulg.—Kasubhag̃-āso, Iloc. Uses.—Padre Blanco says that the yellow juice of this plant “is used by the natives (Filipinos) to treat fissures of the corners of the eyes.” The negros of Senegal use the decoction of the root to cure gonorrhœa. The milky juice to which Blanco refers is used in different countries to treat various skin diseases, including the cutaneous manifestations of syphilis and leprosy; to remove warts, and as an eye wash in catarrhal conjunctivitis. The English physicians of India state that it is dangerous to use the milky juice as an application to the eye, although Dymock claims the contrary. The flowers are narcotic by virtue of a principle resembling morphine, perhaps identical with that alkaloid. The seeds yield a fixed oil on expression, which is laxative and relieves the pains of colic, probably by virtue of its narcotic properties. Physicians in India praise this oil highly; not only is it a sure and painless purgative, but it is free from the viscidity and disgusting taste of castor-oil; besides it has the advantage of operating in small doses, 2–4 grams. Its activity is proportionate to its freshness. Dr. W. O’Shaughnessy does not value this oil highly, but the experience of many distinguished physicians of India has proved the purgative and other properties that have just been mentioned. Possibly the differences of opinion may arise from the fact that oils from different plants were used in the trials. The seeds yield a fixed oil, yellow, clear, of sweet taste, density 0.919 at 15°; it remains liquid at –5°; is soluble in an equal volume of alcohol at 90°; characterized by an orange-red color on adding nitric acid. From its soap Frolicher has obtained acetic, valerianic, butyric and benzoic acids. Charbonnier claims to have found morphine in its leaves and capsules. Dragendorf has isolated from the seeds an alkaloid which presents the principal characters of morphine. It is, then, probable that morphine is the narcotic principle possessed by this plant, which is not hard to believe when one considers the family to which it belongs. Botanical Description.—A plant of American origin nowadays acclimated in almost all warm countries. Its stem is green, pubescent, 30–40 centimeters high. Leaves alternate, thin, sessile, lanceolate, covered with rigid green thorns. Flowers hermaphrodite, terminal, yellow. Calyx, 3 sepals with conical points. Corolla, 6 rounded petals. Stamens indefinite, free, hypogynous. Ovary free, triangular. Capsule expanded, oblong, angular, thickly set with prickles: it opens inferiorly by 5 valves. Cruciferæ. Mustard Family. Brassica juncea, Hook. & Thom. (Sinapis juncea, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Mostaza, Sp.; Mustard, Eng. Uses.—The seeds are used in the same way as those of white or black mustard (Sinapis alba and S. nigra, L.). Botanical Description.—Plant with a glabrous stem, leaves sessile, glabrous, lanceolate, the upper ones serrate, the lower ones almost entire. Flowers in racemes. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 rounded, unguiculate petals. Stamens 6, two of them short and the other four longer and united in pairs. Ovary flattened. Seed vessel quadrangular, nodular, glabrous, containing many oval seeds. Raphanus sativus, L. Nom. Vulg.—Rábano, Sp.; Radish, Eng. Uses.—Used principally as food; it possesses the antiscorbutic properties common to the greater part of the Cruciferæ. It is an herbaceous plant, the root of which is so commonly known that its description would be useless. Capparidaceæ. Caper Family. Cleome viscosa, L. (C. icosandra, L.; Polanisia viscosa, DC.) Nom. Vulg.—Balabalanoyan, Apoyapoyan, Tag.; Wild Mustard, Eng. Uses.—The seeds possess the same properties as those of mustard and are used in place of the latter in Manila. In America the leaves are used as a poultice in otitis, their action being rubefacient. In India the seeds are given internally for their anthelmintic and carminative effect; the dose is one teaspoonful twice a day. The juice of the leaves mixed with cocoanut oil is used in the form of eardrops in suppurative otitis. The natives give the same common name to the Gynandropsis pentaphylla, DC. (Cleome pentaphylla, L.; C. altiacea or C. alliodora, Blanco), which is distinguished from the former by its six stamens inserted on the pistil and its violet-colored stem. Its therapeutic properties are identical with those of the Cleome viscosa. Dr. Sir W. Jones believes that the plant possesses antispasmodic properties, basing his belief on its odor, which resembles asafetida, though not so disagreeable. In India the juice of the leaves is a popular remedy for earache. It is also used there as a rubefacient. Botanical Description.—An annual, the stem channeled and bearing glandular hairs. Leaves compound, alternate; leaflets lanceolate with glandular hairs. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, yellow. Stamens 14–16, encircling the pistil. Seed vessels cylindrical, with channels and glandular hairs. The whole plant is sticky and emits a garlicky odor. Cratæva religiosa, Forst. Nom. Vulg.—Salig̃bobog, Tag.; Balay-namuk, Iloc. Uses.—It is in common use in India as a tonic and stomachic. It seems also to possess laxative and diuretic properties. In Concan the juice of the leaves mixed with cocoanut oil is used as a liniment in rheumatism. Infusion.— Leaves, fresh 50 grams. Water 500 grams. Dose.—50–100 grams a day as a tonic or stomachic. Botanical Description.—A shrub 15–20° high with compound trifoliate leaves with long petioles; leaflets lanceolate, acuminate, smooth, dark green. Calyx of 4 imbricated sepals. Corolla of 4 unguiculate petals, between white and straw color, 1′ long. Stamens indefinite, violet-colored. Ovary unilocular, many-ovuled. Berry spherical with many seeds buried in pulp. Habitat.—Blanco has seen the plant growing in Ilocos and Imus. Bixineæ. Bixa Orellana, L. Nom. Vulg.—Atsuiti, Achuiti, Tag.; Achiote, Achuete, Sp.-Fil.; Annatto, Eng. Uses.—The principal use of the seeds is in cookery and everybody knows the yellow color which Filipino cooks impart to almost all their dishes. In medicine the fine powder that covers the seeds is used as a hæmostatic and internally as a stomachic. On account of the astringent qualities of the coloring matter it is used in some countries to treat dysentery, a fact which suggests its possible therapeutic or rather hygienic usefulness as a condiment. It seems to effect a cure in dysentery in the same manner as ipecac. In India, Brazil and the Antilles the natives make a sort of paste of achuete known under the name of rocu. There is a hard, odorless form of rocu and another soft, unctuous, of a delicate red color and an odor rendered highly disagreeable by the urine added to it to keep it soft. Rocu is the preparation of achuete that has been subjected to chemical analysis. Its composition is as follows: Two coloring matters, bixin (C28H34O5), of a red color, resinous, soluble in alcohol, ether, alkaline solutions and benzine, crystallizing in microscopic laminæ, quadrangular, red, of a metallic violet lustre; orellin, yellow in color, soluble in alcohol and in water. Botanical Description.—A well-known tree growing to a height of 5–7 meters, with leaves alternate, simple, oval, heart-shaped at the base, sharply pointed, glabrous, short petioles. Flowers in panicles. Calyx, 5 rounded sepals, tuberculate at the base, imbricated, caducous. Corolla of 5 rose-colored petals. Stamens very numerous, free, inserted on the receptacle. Capsule round, dark red, bristling with stout hairs of the same color. The seeds are covered with a fine, yellowish-red powder. Pangium edule, Reinw. (Hydonocarpus polyandra, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Pangi, Tag. Uses.—All parts of this tree are anthelmintic. The seeds, fruit, leaves and bark all possess narcotic properties dangerous to man and the symptoms following an excessive dose are sleepiness, headache, a sort of intoxication or an attack of delirium that may end in death. These narcotic properties have been utilized in Java to stupefy the fish in the rivers by throwing the bark in the pools and quiet portions of the stream. The juice of the leaves is used in the treatment of chronic skin diseases. In Amboina the natives eat the seeds, the toxic quality of which is removed by brushing and macerating in pure water for a certain time. After such treatment they may be eaten with impunity and an oil may be extracted from them which is useful as a food. Botanical Description.—A tree with leaves 5′ long, alternate, ovate, broad, entire, glabrous, palmately nerved. Petiole long with 2 persistent lateral stipules. Flowers diœcious, the male ones in panicles, the female solitary. Calyx gamosepalous, dividing unequally when the flower opens. The male flower has a corolla of 5–7 petals, violet-colored, concave, half oval, with pubescent borders; at its base a flat scale. Stamens free, numerous, thick filaments, anthers bilocular. In the female flower the perianth is the same as in the former, the stamens sterile. Ovary unilocular, with 2–4 parietal placentæ with many ovules. Fruit as large as a man’s head, with thin woody pericarp and many seeds embedded within its pulp. Portulacaceæ. Purslane Family. Portulaca oleracea, L. Nom. Vulg.—Verdolagas, Sp.; Olasiman, Kolasiman, Tag.; Purslane, Eng. Uses.—The entire plant is edible, in the form of a salad or as a condiment with meat or fish. The leaves are succulent and acid, and the juice expressed from them is used as an eyewash to remove corneal opacities; it is also used in superficial erysipelas and other skin affections. The bruised leaves are used as a poultice for abscesses, contusions and on the temples for headache. The juice is given internally to check hæmoptysis and in diseases of the lungs and bladder; the seeds also are used in these complaints. Botanical Description.—A plant with prostrate stem. Leaves fleshy, wedge-shaped. Flowers small, sessile, terminal, pale yellow. Calyx of 2 large teeth, deciduous. Corolla, 4–5 petals with a notch at the end. Stamens 9–14. Style of equal length with the stamens. Stigma in 4–6 divisions. The seed vessel, which dehisces horizontally, contains many small, heart-shaped seeds. Habitat.—It grows in all parts of the islands. Guttiferæ. Gamboge Family. Garcinia mangostana, L. Nom. Vulg.—Mangostán, Sp.; Mangosteen, Eng. Uses.—The seed of the fruit is astringent and is given internally as an infusion in dysentery and chronic diarrhœa. The decoction is very useful as an injection in leucorrhœa. The following potion has given excellent results to Dr. Ed. J. Waring in chronic dysentery and the diarrhœas of tropical countries: Dried peel of mangosteen 60 grams. Cumin seed 5 grams. Coriander 5 grams. Water 1,200 grams. Boil till reduced to 600 grams. Take 120 grams twice a day. Tincture of opium may be added. An analysis of mangosteen peel by W. Schmidt demonstrated a large quantity of tannin, a resin and a crystallizable principle named mangostin (C20H23O5) which exists in the form of fine, golden yellow laminæ, tasteless, soluble in alcohol, ether and the alkalies, insoluble in water. With the perchloride of iron it gives a blackish-green color, and sulphuric acid colors it red. Botanical Description.—The mangosteen grows only in the southern islands of the Archipelago and its delicious fruit is the part of the plant known in Manila. The peel is at the present time almost universally employed in medicine. The fruit is about the size of a small Manila orange, the pericarp a dark red or chocolate color, tough and thick, crowned with the remains of the calyx. On breaking it open the edible portion of the fruit is seen, consisting of 6–18 seeds covered by a white, sweet pulp, cottony in appearance, of a delicious slightly acrid flavor. 1. Garcinia venulosa, Choisy. (Cambogia venulosa, Blanco.) 2. G. Cambogia, Desrouss. (Cambogia binucao, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Binukaw, Tag., applied to both trees, though the first is also called Gatasan pulá in Tagalo and Taklag̃-anak in Pampango. Uses.—The fruit of the second species, the true name of which is binucaw, is acid and edible. The fruit and the trunk of both species, when cut, exude a gum-resin very much like gamboge which is obtained from the G. morella or G. pedicellata, Desr. These gum-resins, however, seem to be much inferior to gamboge; they contain an essential oil which does not exist in the latter and their color is paler. Botanical Description.—The G. venulosa is a tree with leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute, entire and glabrous, the inferior surface covered with nervelets which converge at the apex. Petioles short and flattened. Flowers tetramerous. Calyx, 4 persistent sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, overlapping, fleshy, ovate, of the same color as the calyx. Stamens numerous; no filaments; anthers round and very small. Style very short and thick, stigma peltate, divided into 10 parts. Fruit globose, depressed, no well-marked ridges when ripe. G. Cambogia differs from the foregoing in the leaves which present no nervelets on the lower surface and the fruit which presents 8 angles or rounded ridges. Habitat.—Very common throughout the islands, abounding in the mountains of San Mateo and Morong. Blooms in August. Garcinia morella, Desr. Nom. Vulg.—I do not know the name given by the Filipinos to this tree, which Vidal and Soler have seen in Montalván, Tiwi (Albay) and San Mateo (Province of Manila); but it is highly important in medicine as the true gamboge is obtained from it. Gamboge Tree, Eng. The Gamboge of the U. S. P. and B. P. is obtained from G. Hanburii which differs somewhat botanically from G. morella. Uses.—All parts of the plant contain a thick, yellow, milky juice which constitutes the gamboge. In Malabar, Ceylon, Canara and Singapore the following method of extraction is followed: At the beginning of the rainy season a spiral incision is made around the bark of about half the tree trunk, and a piece of bamboo is fixed in place to collect the juice which slowly exudes from the cut for several months, soon becoming viscid and then solid after contact with the air. One tree, as a rule, yields enough sap to fill three internodal segments of bamboo, each 50 cm. long by 3–5 cm. in diameter. Gamboge is a laxative in doses of 10–15 cgm., produces abundant evacuations with violent colicky pains in doses of 30–50 cgm., and is an irritant poison in large doses. In other words it is a highly energetic hydragogue cathartic, especially indicated when we wish to drain off the fluid element of the blood, as in dropsy, asthma, pulmonary and cerebral congestion. It is also used as a vermifuge. It is rarely given alone, but is combined with calomel, aloes, jalap, rhubarb, etc. It is official in all pharmacopœias. Botanical Description.—A tree 10–20 meters high, with leaves opposite, elliptical, lanceolate, narrowed at both extremities, acuminate, entire, coriaceous, glabrous, 10–12 cm. long by 3–4 cm. broad, with short petioles. Flowers diœcious. Male flower axillary, solitary or in groups of 3–6, pedunculate with small bracts. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, orbicular, thick, fleshy. Stamens 30–40, sessile, adherent at the base. Anthers unilocular. Female flower sessile, solitary, axillary, larger than the male; calyx and corolla equal; staminodia 20–30, jointed at the base, forming a membranous corolla from the upper edge of which spring a few short filaments which support each a suboval sterile anther. The ovary is superior and almost spherical, with 4 cells each containing 1 ovule. The fruit, almost spherical, is 2½ cm. in diameter, corticate, bearing at its base the persistent calyx; each of its 4 cells contains a seed. Ochrocarpus pentapetalous, Blanco. (Tovomita pentapetala, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Namakpakan, Tagudin, Iloc. (?). Uses.—An oil expressed from the fruit is used in Ilocos for illuminating purposes. The flowers are astringent and are used in infusion in cases of diarrhœa. The oil of the fruit is also used locally in rheumatism, tumefactions and other painful conditions. In some countries of Malaysia the oil is used in the same way especially in beriberi and the periarticular inflammations incident to puerperium. Botanical Description.—Straight trunk about 8′ in diameter, with milky sap. Leaves 1½’ long, sessile, opposite, ovate, expanded, minutely notched and glabrous, with a small downy swelling at the base, superior and glued to the branch. Flowers terminal, in racemes, with opposite pedicels. Calyx white, of 2 rounded leaflets bent downwards. Corolla white, 5 petals (not 4), oval, concave, twice as long as the calyx. Stamens numerous, joined to the receptacle. Filaments slightly longer than the corolla. Anthers oval, 2-celled. Ovary superior, oval. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma peltate, sometimes bilobed, sometimes 4-lobed. Fruit about the size of an acorn, oval, fleshy, containing a milky juice; it is 2-celled and each cell contains a solitary, hard seed; of these one aborts. Habitat.—It grows near the sea. Blooms in December. Calophyllum Inophyllum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Palo Maria, Sp.-Fil.; Bitanhol, Tamawian, Dankalan, Dinkalin, Tag.; Dankalan Bitaog, Vis., Pam., Bik. Uses.—From the seeds of the fruit there exudes a yellowish-green oil, bitter and aromatic. It is used in some districts for illuminating purposes. Its density is 0.942 and its point of solidification 5° above zero. In India it is used by inunction in rheumatism and in the Philippines locally over the stomach in indigestion and colic. The bark of the tree when incised exudes a green resin of a very agreeable odor, which is used as an application to wounds and old sores. In India it is used in the same way. This resin is fusible and dissolves completely in alcohol. It has been mistaken for the tacamahaca of India, which, however, is a product of the C. calaba, L. Mixed with equal parts of pitch and wax it is applied to the chest as a plaster in bronchitis. A decoction of the leaves is used for purulent ophthalmia in some parts of India and Mauritius. The pounded bark is applied locally in orchitis and epididymitis. We have had occasion to use a mixture of equal parts of the resin with white vaseline spread on linen and applied between the shoulder blades; in the persistent cough of senile bronchitis the relief was marked. Botanical Description.—A large tree with beautiful, dark green leaves 4–5′ long, opposite, entire, large, oval with nerves numerous, fine and perpendicular to the midrib. Petioles very short. Flowers large, white, sweet-scented, axillary, in racemes of 7–9. Calyx white, of 4 sepals. Corolla white, of 4 petals. Stamens numerous, polyadelphous. Ovary rudimentary in the male flower; unilocular and uniovulate in the female. Style single and large. Drupe superior, with a hard, bony pit, containing a thicker, softer substance which envelopes a seed of like consistency. Habitat.—It is found in central Luzon and in the Provinces of Tayabas, La Union and Ilocos. Blooms in November. Mesua ferrea, L. (Calophyllum apetalum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Malabukbuk (?), Tag. Uses.—We do not know to what use the Filipinos put this plant, but in India the sweet flowers are dried and sold in the bazars under the name of Nag-Kasar or Nagesur, which is used as a mild stimulant, but especially as a perfume. A dark oil is expressed from the seeds, its density 0.954 and its solidifying point 5° above zero. In northern Canara it is used locally in rheumatism. The incised root bark exudes a resinous sap which is a good bitter tonic. The infusion of the wood is equally good. The dried flowers, finely powdered and mixed with oil or lard make a useful ointment for acute hemorrhoids. The fruit is acrid and purgative. Botanical Description.—A tree with leaves long-petioled, oblong, lanceolate, acuminate, rounded at the base, thick, coriaceous, upper surface lustrous, lower surface greenish or covered with a waxy, ash-colored powder. Flowers terminal or axillary, solitary, yellowish. Calyx 4 imbricated sepals, orbiculate, slightly pubescent. Corolla 4 persistent petals, wedge-shaped, short, with rounded points. Stamens indefinite, free, in 5–6 series. Ovary free, 2-celled, each cell containing 2 ovules. Style bilobed. Fruit nearly unilocular, ovate, acuminate, encompassed at its base by the sepals, the lower part of the petals, and crowned by the style. Pericarp woody, dehiscent at the tip by 2–4 valves; contains 1–4 seeds, slightly orbiculate, coriaceous. Habitat.—Common in the forests. Dipterocarpeæ. Dipterocarpus turbinatus, Gaertn. (D. Indicus, Bedd.; D. Mayapis, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Mayapis, Tag.; Gurjun, Kanyin, Indo-Eng. Uses.—This tree yields an oleo resin, used in medicine and known under the name of bálsamo de gurjun. Other species of Dipterocarpus (D. alatus, Roxb.; D. incanus, Roxb.; D. trinervis, Bl., etc., etc.) produce the same substance. Balsam of Gurjun is a stimulant of the mucous membranes, especially those of the genito-urinary tract, and is diuretic. It is also indicated in bronchial catarrh and as a local application in ulcer. The first to recommend the use of gurjun as a substitute for copaiba was Sir W. O’Shaughnessy in 1838, and in 1852 this property was confirmed by Waring with highly satisfactory results. Dr. Enderson of Glasgow employed it in cases that received no benefit from copaiba, giving a teaspoonful t. i. d. in emulsion. Dr. Rean also classed it as equal to copaiba in efficiency. The daily dose ranges from 5–20 grams, in liquid or pill. The following is an excellent formula for an emulsion: Cinnamon water 125 grams. Sodium carbonate, crystals 2 grams. Balsam of gurjun 25 grams. Syrup of gum 25 grams. Sulphuric ether 2 grams. Mix and shake. Dose.—6–12 large spoonfuls each day, for the declining stage of gonorrhœa. In Burmah they extract the balsam by the following method: A large hole is cut in the trunk of the tree and a fire is built in this cavity and kept up till the wood of the trunk begins to burn, by which time the oleo resin has collected in abundance in the segments of bamboo placed to receive it. When the exudate diminishes, fire is again placed in the cavity and one tree may tolerate 2, 3 or even 4 of these cavities. The exudate on standing separates into 2 parts; a solid called “guad” which forms the lower layer, and a supernatant liquid which is the balsam. It is dense, viscid and very fluorescent; opaque and gray-green by reflected light. It has an odor similar to that of copaiba, is bitter and aromatic. Its density is 0.964. It is soluble in benzine, in bisulphuret of carbon, chloroform, the essential oils and less so in ether and acetic acid. It becomes turbid and coagulates if it be kept at 100° for some time and it solidifies at 200°, while copaiba remains liquid at this temperature. A specimen of the balsam examined by Flückiger consisted of 54.44 parts semifluid resin and 45.56 volatile material. Upon distillation it yields an essential oil, of slight odor, straw-colored; formula C20H32 (Werner). If purified its density is 0.915. It is soluble in amylic alcohol, scarcely so in absolute alcohol. Hydrochloric acid colors it a beautiful blue. The resin remaining after distillation, dissolved in alcohol 0.838 with the addition of ammonia, yields as a precipitate a crystalline acid (gurjunic acid), C44H64O8, soluble in alcohol 0.838, in ether, in benzol and bisulphide of carbon. It melts at 220° (Werner), solidifies at 180° and is decomposed at 260°. Botanical Description.—A very large, handsome tree with leaves about 5′ in length, alternate, ovate, broad and lanceolate, entire, glabrous and membranaceous. Petioles very short. Flowers terminal, paniculate, handsome, fragrant. Calyx free, 5 lanceolate sepals, of which 2 are slightly longer than the others. Corolla, 5 yellow oblong petals longer than the sepals. Stamens numerous, attached to the receptacle. Filaments very short. Anthers of 2 divisions each ending in a long beard. Ovary half buried in the receptacle. A single thick style. Three simple stigmas. Seed vessel of 3 cells, seeds in pairs. Habitat.—In Luzon in the mountains of Tala, Angat and San Mateo; in Mindanao, Paragua, Balabac and Negros. Blooms in June. Malvaceæ. Mallow Family. Sida carpinifolia, L. (S. acuta, Burm.; S. stipulata, Cav.; S. frutescens, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Wawalisan, Eskobag̃haba, Pamalis, Higot-balato, Mamalis, Tag., Vis., Pam. Uses.—The root is emollient and bitter. The decoction is used as a lotion for ulcers, and internally as a sudorific and tonic-astringent. The physicians of India prescribe the powdered root with milk for fevers and for nervous and urinary diseases. The leaves are used locally in ophthalmia. The juice of the root is employed as a wash for all kinds of sores and ulcers and the juice of the entire plant is given for spermatorrhœa. After experimenting with the root, the compilers of the Bengal Dispensatory announced their uncertainty as to whether or not it possessed antipyretic properties; however, they pronounce it diaphoretic, an exciter of the appetite and an excellent bitter tonic. In Goa the Portuguese consider it diuretic and use it especially in rheumatic affections. The root of S. carpinifolia gives a blue color with the salts of iron. It does not precipitate gelatin and contains asparagin. Botanical Description.—A plant 2–4° high with woody, branching stem, leaves alternate, oblong, pointed, serrate, under surface neither hoary nor tomentose as in some other species of Sida. Petioles very short, curved near the leaf, 2 stipules near the base. Flowers axillary, solitary. Calyx simple, in 5 parts. Corolla, 5 petals notched obliquely. Stamens numerous, inserted on the end of a column. Anthers globose. Styles 5, mingled with the stamens. Stigmas globose. Cells of the same number as the styles, verticillate, with solitary seeds. Habitat.—Common in Luzon, Panay, Mindanao, Paragua, Cebú and Balabac. Abutilon Indicum, Don. (Sida Indica, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Kuakuakohan, Gilig̃-gilig̃an, Tag.; Tabig̃, Malis, Dulupag, Pilis, Vis.; Malvas de Castilla, Sp.-Fil. Uses.—The trunk bark is slightly bitter, and in decoction is used as a diuretic. An infusion of the leaves and flowers is used as an emollient in place of mallows. The infusion of the root is used for the same effect, as a lotion or injection. I have often had occasion to employ this plant and would never use the Philippine mallow in place of it. Botanical Description.—A plant 3–4° high, all its parts covered with hairs, simple and tomentose. Leaves heart-shaped, angular, obtuse, unequally serrate, smooth, soft, the lower surface hoary and bearing 9 well-marked nerves. Petioles longer than the leaves, with 2 stipules at the base. Flowers yellow, axillary, solitary. Peduncles long, with a node near the end. Calyx, 5 sepals, as in all the Malvaceæ. Corolla, 5 petals with a small notch at the end. Stamens very numerous as well as the styles. Both arise from the summit of a very short column and twist in all directions forming a tassel or tuft. Fruit much higher than the calyx, of 10–20 cells or carpels which are broad, compressed, hairy, the walls united toward the center, each containing 2–3 seeds. Habitat.—Common in Luzon, Panay, Mindanao and other islands. Blooms in September. Urena sinuata, L. (U. morifolia and muricata, DC.; U. multifida, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kulutan, Kulutkulutan, Molopolo, Tag., Vis., Pam. Uses.—The infusion of the root is used internally as an emollient and refrigerant; externally in skin diseases accompanied by smarting and inflammation. The boiled and pounded leaves are used as a poultice in inflammation of the intestines and bladder. Botanical Description.—A spreading plant 4–6° high, with straight stem, leaves cleft at the base, serrate and hairy; the larger ones have 5–6 lobules which subdivide into smaller ones and bear a small gland in the inferior surface of the midrib. Petioles short. Flowers terminal and racemose. Calyx double, composed of 5 narrow sepals externally, and 5 colored sepals internally alternating with the outer ones. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens numerous, inserted about a small column. Styles 10, on the end of the column. Stigmas thick, covered with little spheres. Five united carpels, kidney-shaped, bristling with short stiff hairs, containing solitary seeds. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the Archipelago. Hibiscus Abelmoschus, L. Nom. Vulg.—Kastuli, Kastio, Kastiogan, Dalupan, Tag.; Marikum, Dukum, Marukum, Marapoto, Vis.;2 Marsh Mallow, Eng. Uses.—The bruised seeds emit an odor of musk, and for this reason the plant has received the name Kastuli, signifying musk in Sanscrit. They possess antispasmodic and stimulant properties, and the infusion is diuretic. Bonastre3 analyzed Kastuli seeds as follows: Water and parenchyma 52.00 Gum 36.00 Albumin 5.60 Fixed oil, resin, crystals and odorous principles 6.40   Total 100.00 The fixed oil is greenish-yellow, fluid, but gradually solidifying in the air. The crystalline material is white, of an agreeable odor, soluble in ether, where it crystallizes in rays, fusible at 35°. The odorous principle is a bright green, non-volatile liquid of the odor of musk. Botanical Description.—A plant 5–6° high, the stem hairy and with few branches. Leaves heart-shaped, cleft at the base, with 5 large pointed lobes, serrate, pubescent. Petioles long with two awl-shaped stipules at the base, and a large violet spot in the axil. Calyx double; the outer sepals 8–9 in number, awl-shaped; the inner ones are larger and separate unequally when the flower expands. Both sets are deciduous. Corolla very large, yellow. Stamens very numerous, inserted around a column. One pistil. Five stigmas. Ovary very large, downy, ovoid, 5-angled, with 5 compartments, each containing many kidney-shaped seeds with numerous grooves concentric at the hilum. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the islands. Hibiscus tiliaceus, L. Nom. Vulg.—Balibago, Tag., Pam.; Malabago, Vis. Uses.—An infusion of the leaves is used as a wash for ulcers and indolent sores. The flowers boiled in milk are used to relieve the pain of earache (Blanco), the warm milk being dropped into the external canal. The powdered bark in dose of 3 grams is emetic(?) (Blanco). Botanical Description.—A small tree 6–12° high with leaves 4–6′ long, alternate, 7-nerved, cleft at the base, abruptly acute, scalloped, pubescent. Petioles long. Flowers axillary, in panicles of very small flowerets. Calyx double, the outer portion divided into 8–9 teeth, the inner into 5 longer parts. Stamens numerous, inserted about a column. Style 1. Stigmas 5. Ovary of 5 cells, each containing 2 seeds. Habitat.—Abounds in all parts of the islands. Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis, L. Nom. Vulg.—Takurag̃an, Arog̃anan, Kayag̃a, Tapulag̃a, Gumamila, Tag., Vis., Pam.; Rose of China, Eng. Uses.—The flowers are emollient and are widely used by the Filipinos as a domestic remedy; they are bruised and applied to boils, tumors and all sorts of inflammations. The decoction is much used internally in bronchial catarrh for its sudorific effect. The Chinese use the trunk bark as an emmenagogue, calling it Fu-yong-pi. Botanical Description.—A small tree about 7° high commonly called Gumamela in Manila; the leaves are ovate, acute, with about 5 nerves, serrate from the middle to the apex, hairs growing sparsely on both surfaces, with a small group of dark-colored, deciduous hairs growing on the lower part of the midrib. Petioles short with 2 stipules at the base. Calyx double, the outer part divided almost to the base into 6–8 parts; the inner cylindrical, divided in 5. Corolla large, splendid scarlet-red, often double, on slender peduncles. Styles numerous. Fruit identical with that of the Hibiscus tiliaceus. Habitat.—Universally common in the Philippines. Thespesia populnea, Corr. Nom. Vulg.—Babuy or Bobuy gubat, Tag.; Bulakan, Vis. Uses.—The fruit yields a yellow juice which is used locally in the itch and other cutaneous troubles, after first washing the affected part with a decoction of the roots and leaves. The bark is astringent and is used as a decoction in the treatment of dysentery and hemorrhoids. Botanical Description.—A tree of the second order with leaves 4–5′ long, sparse, 5-nerved, heart-shaped, broad, acute, entire, glabrous, 6 small glands on the lower face of the base. Petioles of equal length with the leaves. Flowers large, axillary, solitary. Calyx double, the outer portion deciduous, consisting of 3 small, acute leaflets inserted on the base of the inner calyx; the inner is bell-shaped, larger than the outer, with 5 inconspicuous, persistent teeth. Corolla four times longer than the calyx, of 5 fleshy, fluted petals, their borders overlapping, much broader above. Stamens very numerous, arranged around and along a column. Filaments long. Anthers of half-moon shape. Style 1, very thick. Stigma cleft in 5 parts, which are twisted in spiral form. Seed vessels about the size of a filbert, 5-sided, with 5 apartments each containing 5 ovoid seeds attached by separate seed stalks to the central axis of the ovary. Seeds not woolly. Habitat.—Mandaloya Tayabas, Iloilo. Gossypium herbaceum, L. (G. Indicum, Lam.; G. Capas, Rumph.) Nom. Vulg.—Algodón, Sp.; Bulak, Tag.; Cotton, Eng. Uses.—The root bark is antiasthmatic, emmenagogue, and according to Daruty4 is a substitute for ergot in uterine hemorrhage. The leaves are used in bronchial troubles and the seeds are sudorific. The negroes in the United States use the root bark in large doses as an abortifacient; but a dose of 60 grams to 1,200 of water in decoction is proper and useful in treating dysmenorrhœa. For a long time the seeds went to waste but industry has learned to obtain from them a brownish-red oil which is used as a substitute for olive oil, from which it is hard to distinguish it, if the latter is adulterated by mixing the two; for both have the same density and a very similar odor and taste. For this reason the production of cottonseed oil is very considerable nowadays. It is cheap and excellent for domestic, industrial and pharmaceutic use. The seeds are used in North America in dysentery and as a galactagogue, and the juice of the leaves as an emollient in diarrhœa and mild dysentery. The pulp of the seeds, after the oil is extracted, yields a sweet material called gossypose, which is dextrogyrous and has the formula C18H32O16 + 5H2O. The cotton itself, the part used in commerce as a textile, is also the portion of the plant most widely employed in therapeutics; not only the fiber from this species is used, but also that of others that grow in the Philippines, the G. Barbadense, L. (nom. vulg. Pernambuko, Tag.), and the G. arboreum, L. (Bulak na bundok, Bulak na totoo, Tag.). Cotton is used extensively in bacteriological laboratories as a filter of liquids and gases. This property possessed by cotton, of retaining in its fibers the germs of the air was utilized by the famous French surgeon Guérin in the treatment that bears his name. The denuded surfaces exposed to infection by airborne bacteria are completely protected against them when, according to the Guérin treatment, they are enveloped in large masses of fresh, raw cotton, presumably free from microörganisms. To avoid the possibility of infection by the cotton itself, it is now the practice to sterilize it either by means of chemicals such as carbolic acid, iodoform, etc., or by physical means such as high temperatures. Raw cotton is used in compounding gun cotton or explosive cotton, also named pyroxylin, and this is used to make collodion, so extensively employed in medicine. Pyroxylin is made by treating cotton with equal parts of nitric and sulphuric acids, then washing with water till the latter ceases to give a precipitate with chloride of baryta; then dry in the air. Collodion is made by dissolving 5 grams of pyroxylin in the following mixture: Sulphuric ether, rectified 75 grams. Alcohol at 95° 20 grams. Filter. Elastic collodion: Canada Balsam 1.50 grams. Castor oil .50 grams. Collodion 30.00 grams. Mix. Botanical Description.—A plant 2–3° high, of herbaceous stem, branches sparsely covered with small, black points; leaves cleft at their base, with 5 lobules and a small gland on the midrib. Petiole long with 2 stipules at the base. Flowers axillary, solitary. Calyx double; the outer portion divided in 3 parts, heart-shaped, and each with 5–9 long, acute teeth. Corolla bell-shaped, of 5 petals, pale yellow or turning rose color, purple at the base. Stamens many, inserted on a column. Stigma in 4–5 parts. Ovary of 3–5 compartments. Seeds enveloped in the fiber. Habitat.—Batangas, Ilocos. Bombax malabaricum, DC. (B. Ceiba, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Taglinaw, Bobuy gubat, Tag.; Talutu, Vis. Uses.—In India the roots are used to obtain an astringent and alterative effect and form part of a well-known aphrodisiac mixture called Musla-Samul. If the trunk is incised, an astringent gum exudes and this they use in diarrhœa, dysentery and menorrhagia. Dose of the gum 2½–3 grams. Botanical Description.—A large tree covered with sharp, conical and tough spines. Leaves alternate, compound, digitate, caducous; leaflets 5–7 with long common petiole. Flowers solitary or in axillary cymes, hermaphrodite, regular. Calyx gamosepalous, cup-shaped, with 5 acute lobules. Corolla violet, with 5 deep clefts; æstivation convolute. Stamens numerous, united at the base in 5 bundles, free above, bearing unilocular anthers. Ovary of 5 many-ovulate compartments, with a style ending in 5 short branches. Capsule woody, ovoid, loculicidal, with 5 valves. Seeds numerous, black, covered with cottony fibers. Habitat.—Angat, Iloilo. Blooms in February. Eriodendron anfractuosum, DC. (Bombax pentandrum, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Boboy, Tag.; Doldol, Vis.; Bulak kastila, Pam. Uses.—The principal use made of this plant in the Philippines is to stuff the pillows with the cotton that it yields. The leaves, pounded with a little water, yield a mucilaginous juice highly prized by the natives as a wash for the hair, mixing it with gogo. The root bark is emetic in dose of 1.25 grm. The cotton yielded by this tree should be used for the same therapeutic purposes as that of gossypium, and being of an exceedingly fine fiber it would give better results. The Filipinos use it to treat burns and sores. I have often used it, being careful always to impregnate it thoroughly with some antiseptic solution. In the treatment of burns it has been my custom to envelope the part in a thick layer of this cotton, after bathing it with a tepid 1–2,000 solution of corrosive sublimate and dusting with a very fine powder of boracic acid. Botanical Description.—A tree 40–50° high. Trunk somewhat thorny, the branches horizontal, arranged in stars of 3–4. Leaves compound with 7 leaflets, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in umbels of 8 or more flowerets. No common peduncle, the individual ones long. Calyx, 5 obtuse sepals, slightly notched. Corolla, 5 fleshy petals, obtusely lanceolate and bent downwards. Stamens 5. Anthers of irregular shape, peltate, with the borders deeply undulate. Stigma in 5 parts. Pod 4–6′ long, spindle-shaped. Seeds enveloped in very fine cotton fiber. Habitat.—Exceedingly common in all parts of the islands. Blooms in December. Sterculiaceæ. Sterculia Family. Sterculia fœtida, L. (S. polyphilla, R. Br.; Clompanus major, Rumph.) Nom. Vulg.—Kalumpag̃, Tag.; Bag̃ar, Iloc. Uses.—A decoction of the leaves is used as a wash in suppurative cutaneous eruptions. The fruit is astringent and is used in Java as an injection for gonorrhœa. In western India and in the Philippines it is an article of diet. The seeds yield an oil that is used for illumination and as a comestible. Botanical Description.—A large tree of the first order with digitate leaves of 6–8 leaflets, broad, oval, very acute, tough, glabrous, growing on a long common petiole. No petiole proper. Flowers of a fœtid or feculent odor, hermaphrodite, in compound racemes. Calyx fleshy, soft pubescent internally, bell-shaped, in 5 parts. Corolla none. Nectary 5-toothed, on the end of a small column. Stamens 15, inserted on the border of the nectary by threes, forming a triangle. Filament almost entirely wanting. In the midst of the stamens is visible a small, hairy body of 5 lobules which are the rudiments of the ovaries. The style protrudes and twists downwards. Stigma thick, compressed, of 5 lobules. Fruit, five woody pods, semicircular, joined to a common center, each enclosing many oval seeds inserted in the superior suture. Habitat.—Luzon, Mindanao, Cebú, Iloilo. Blooms in March. Sterculia urens, Roxb. (S. cordifolia, Blanco; Cavallium urens, Schott. & Endl.) Nom. Vulg.—Banilad, Tag. Uses.—The root bark is pounded up and applied locally in orchitis and in severe contusions with supposed fracture of the bones; native charlatans pretend to cure the latter condition by this treatment. The trunk exudes a sort of gum, which with water forms a sort of colorless, odorless gelatin which dissolves at the boiling point. I do not know to what use this gum is applied in therapeutics, but it is often found mixed with the Senegambian gum acacia. Botanical Description.—A tree with leaves bunched, 7–9-veined, heart-shaped, ovate, broad and entire, glabrous upper surface, short white down on lower surface. Petioles of same length as the leaves. Flowers small, yellow, numerous, polygamous, growing in large, terminal panicles covered with a fine, sticky down. Calyx bell-shaped, 5 acute papyraceous divisions, each bearing a small gland near its base. No corolla. Stamens 10, united in a column, the upper ends free. Five pods joined at one point, half-moon shaped, with woody shell, glabrous within and with a short down on the outer surface. Three or four kidney-shaped seeds, the testa thin and crustaceous. Habitat.—Cebú, Iloilo. Kleinhovia hospitata, L. Nom. Vulg.—Tanag, Tag., Vis.; Hamitanago, Vis.; Panampat, Pam.; Bitnog̃, Iloc. Uses.—The decoction of the leaves is used, according to P. Blanco, to cure the itch. It is also used locally in all forms of dermatitis, and the tender leaves and sprouts are cooked and eaten. Botanical Description.—Tree 25° high or more, with leaves alternate, heart-shaped, pubescent, almost entire. Petioles long with 2 stipules at the base. Flowers red, axillary, in large panicles. Calyx, 5 sepals, almost linear. Corolla the same size as the calyx, 5 linear petals, the lower shorter and curved. Nectary bell-shaped, of 5 parts, each 3-toothed; set on a column; at its base a wavy fringe with dentate edge. Stamens 15. No filaments. Anthers seated on the 15 teeth of the nectary. Ovary within the nectary, 5-angled, 5 apartments each containing an almost spherical seed. Habitat.—Luzon, Mindanao, Panay, Cebú, Joló. Flowers in March and September. Helicteres Isora, L. (H. chrysocalyx, Miq.; H. Roxburghii, G. Don.) Nom. Vulg.—(?); Indian Screw Tree, Eng. Uses.—I am ignorant of the use that the Filipinos make of this plant, though it is very possible that they do not employ it at all in medicine, which is usually the case with those plants to which they have given no name. In India the peculiar spiral form of the fruit has suggested its application, according to the theories of the doctrine of symbolism. Ainslie says that the Hindoos use it to treat diseases of the external auditory canal. On account of its emollient properties and probably on account of its twisted form, it is used internally as a decoction, in flatulence and the intestinal colic of children. It is indispensable in the marriage ceremonies of the caste of Vaisya, among whom it is customary for the groom to wear on his wrists in the form of bracelets, strings of this fruit combined with that of Randia dumetorum. The root yields a juice which is employed in skin diseases, in abscess, acid in cardialgia. In Jamaica the juice of the leaves is sometimes used for constipation. Botanical Description.—A small tree with leaves alternate, simple, entire, irregularly nerved or veined at the base, petiolate. Flowers of a handsome red color, hermaphrodite, regular, axillary. Calyx gamosepalous, tubular, of 5 parts. Corolla, 5 free petals slightly dentate at the point. Stamens numerous, united on a free column on the cusp. Compound nectary of 5 unilocular, many-ovuled ovaries. Styles 5, joined at the base. Fruit of 5 carpels, thin, twisted on themselves in spirals, forming a cone, pubescent, of a greenish-brown color, each containing a single row of angular seeds. Habitat.—Luzon, Panay. Abroma fastuosa, R. Br. (A. angulata, Lam.; A. communis, Blanco; A. augusta, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Anibog̃, Tag.; Anabo, Vis.; Perennial Indian Hemp, Eng. Uses.—The root bark is used in India as an emmenagogue in the congestive and neuralgic forms of amenorrhœa. It seems to act as a uterine tonic. The dose is 2 grams of the juice of the fresh root mixed with pepper which also acts as a carminative and stomachic. Botanical Description.—A shrub 3–4 meters high with hairy branches. Leaves opposite, oval, oblong, serrate, tomentose. Flowers purple, solitary, terminal. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, united in the form of a tube. Ovary sessile, with 5 many-ovuled compartments. Styles 5, united in the form of a tube which divides into 5 stigma-bearing branches. Capsule membranous, 5-angled, truncate, dehiscent at apex. Seeds albuminous, covered with filaments of cotton. Habitat.—San Mateo, La Laguna, Batangas, Iloilo. Theobroma Cacao, L. Nom. Vulg.—Cacao. Uses.—The roasted bean ground with sugar constitutes chocolate, one of the most generally used foods of the Philippines. It is very nutritious by virtue of the fat and sugar it contains, but all stomachs do not bear it well and its use is the unsuspected cause of much dyspepsia. The custom of drinking it very hot and following with a large quantity of cold water is a very common cause of dilatation of the stomach in the Philippines. The seed of the cacao contains several substances: cacao butter, albumin, theobromine, starch, glucose, gum, tartaric acid, free or combined, tannin, and mineral substances. Of these the butter and theobromine are the most important. Theobromine (C7H8N4O2) is a weak alkaloid, crystalline, slightly bitter, slightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in hot water, less soluble in alcohol and ether; stable in the air up to 100°; sublimes without decomposition at 290° in microscopic crystals of the form of rhomboid prisms ending in an octohedric point (Keller). This alkaloid is very little used in therapeutics and its physiological action is said to be analogous to that of caffeine but weaker. It is better to use the salt of the alkaloid, and that most frequently employed is the salicylate of soda and theobromine in doses of from 2 to 6 grams daily in solution or pill. Lately, however, Dr. Gram has maintained that theobromine is a powerful diuretic operating when other diuretics fail and further that this effect is produced without injuring the heart. The double salt is non-toxic, though sometimes in exceedingly weak patients it produces vertigo. Dr. Gram administers 6 grams a day in one-gram doses. Cacao butter is a white substance, slightly yellowish, unctuous to the touch, brittle; with the agreeable odor peculiar to cacao, and a sweet and pleasant taste. Its density is 0.961, it melts at 30°–33°, and solidifies at 25°. It dissolves in 20 parts of boiling alcohol, in 100 parts of cold alcohol and in twice its weight of benzin. Cacao butter is obtained by grinding or mashing the roasted seeds in a hot apparatus and mixing the mass with a fifth or tenth of its weight of boiling water. It is then pressed between two hot iron plates and the butter thus obtained is refined by boiling water. It is then put aside in earthen pans, or still better, in moulds, where it solidifies. It does not easily become rancid and, for this reason, enters into the composition of many ointments and pomades, or is used alone. It serves as the base for suppositories and is, finally, a highly valued cosmetic. A common substitute is made by mixing oil of almonds, wax and animal fat. Before going further let us describe the composition of Spanish chocolate according to the French chemist Boussingault: Cane sugar 41.40 grams. Cacao butter 29.24 grams. Starch, glucose 1.48 grams. Theobromine 1.93 grams. Asparagin a trace Albumin 6.25 grams. Gum 1.42 grams. Tartaric acid 1.98 grams. Tannin and coloring matter 0.022 grams. Soluble cellulose 6.21 grams. Ash 2.34 grams. Water 4.36 grams. Undetermined material 3.27 grams. 100.00 Botanical Description.—A small tree about 10° high, with leaves broad, 6–12′ long, hanging or drooping, lanceolate, entire, and somewhat pubescent on both surfaces. Petioles very short with 2 deciduous stipules at the base. Flowers in clusters on the roots, trunk and branches. Peduncle very long. Nectary divided in 5 parts, straight, awl-shaped and 2-nerved. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals curved upward in the form of a bow as far as the middle, where they form a hollow with two little horns; then curving downwards, then upwards, widening at the end, the edge finely dentate. Stamens 5, inserted on the nectary, and alternating with the lobes of the latter. Anthers 2 on each filament, concealed in the hollows of the petals. Ovary globose. Style awl-shaped. Stigma cleft almost to the middle, 5-parted. Fruit broad, spindle-shaped, 4′ or more long, dark reddish, warty, 10-ribbed, with 5 compartments each containing many compressed, ovoid seeds. Habitat.—Common in orchards and gardens throughout the islands. Geraniaceæ. Geranium Family. Oxalis corniculata, L. (O. Acetosella, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Taig̃an dogá, Susokayoli, Tag.; Darasig, Vis.; Malabalugbug dagis, Ayo, Kongi, Yayo, Pam.; Indian Sorrel, Eng. Uses.—The part of the plant used in medicine is the leaf which is acid by virtue of the potassium oxalate which it contains. The decoction is used internally as an antipyretic in fevers and in dysentery. Mistaking the properties of the plant it is given for vesical calculus which, if composed of oxalates, would be increased instead of diminished by the treatment. In fact the salt of sorrel in the leaves contains a large quantity of oxalic acid mixed with potassium oxalate. In China, India and the Philippines the entire plant is used as an antiscorbutic. The cold infusion of the leaves is given internally in doses of from 30 to 60 grams, but it is not a medicine to be given indiscriminately, because in addition to its power of adding to the bulk of calculi of the oxalates, the contained potassium oxalate is poisonous in doses of 25 to 30 grams. If a concentrated solution is taken, it operates as a corrosive poison, producing violent pains in the stomach, vomiting, faintness and great weakness. If the solution is dilute its absorption is rapid and it operates very energetically. When a patient is poisoned by a concentrated solution, the stomach-pump is contraindicated, because the mucous membrane of the organ is corroded and ulcerated; if by a dilute solution, use the pump to remove as much of the poison as possible. The best antidote is a watery solution of a soluble salt of lime, i. e., the saccharate, which forms an insoluble salt with oxalic acid. The juice of the leaves is an antidote for the Datura (Stramonium). In India they make a decoction of the plant, mix it with onion juice and apply it to the head as a fomentation in hemicrania. Botanical Description.—A plant 1° high, with a creeping, glabrous stem, leaves horizontal, ternate with common long petiole. Leaflets sessile, obcordate, with downy borders. Flowers axillary or terminal, from 1 to 3 in number on a common long peduncle. The pedicel is also long. Calyx common to the family. Corolla, 5 petals ending in small claws. Stamens 10, monadelphous, the 5 shorter ones bearing each a small gland on the outer surface of the base. Ovary large, fluted. Styles 5, short. Stigmas hemispherical. Seed vessel pyramidal, containing many seeds enveloped in an elastic aril by which they are ejected when the fruit opens. Habitat.—Abundant in Luzon, Panay and Cebú. Biophytum sensitivum, DC. (B. cumiagianum, Turez.; Oxalis sensitivum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Makahiya, Damog̃hiya, Tag.; Mahihiin, Iloc. Uses.—A decoction of the leaves is used internally as an expectorant. The bruised leaves are used as an application to wounds and contusions. In Java the decoction is used internally in asthma, phthisis and snake bites. The peculiar property which this plant possesses of closing its leaves when touched, has caused the natives of India to attribute to it mysterious virtues. Symbolism has determined its therapeutic application and the Hindoos pretend that it endows with delicacy and modesty women who lack these virtues and that it restores virginity. Botanical Description.—A plant about 7′ high. Stem straight, nodose and without branches. Leaves abruptly pinnate, the place of the odd leaflet taken by a stylet. The leaflets nearly linear with a small point at the apex, 11–13 pairs, 2 stipules to each pair. Common petioles long, cleft at the base and disposed in whorls around and on the end of the stem. Flowers sessile, verticillate, on the ends of several very long peduncles which rise from the midst of the petioles. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals, clawed, rounded at the end and slightly notched, forming a tube. Stamens 10, free. A small gland on the outer surface of the base of each short stamen. Styles 5. Seed vessels ovate, 5-angled, containing many seeds. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the islands. Averrhoa Bilimbi, L. Nom. Vulg.—Kamias, Kalamias, Tag.; Kilingiwa, Vis.; Pias, Iloc. Uses.—The small fruit of the camia springing from the branches and trunks of the trees is widely known in the Philippines, where they eat it green, pickled, and in salad; and when ripe fresh and preserved. Its qualities and therapeutic applications are the same as those of the following species. Botanical Description.—A tree 4–5 meters high with odd-pinnate leaves. Leaflets 12 pairs, ovate, linear, acute, soft and downy. Flowers small, pinkish or purplish, on trunk and branches. Stamens 10, five alternately longer. Pistils divergent. Fruit oblong, obtuse at the end, with five broad ribs. Habitat.—Very common throughout the islands. Averrhoa Carambola, L. Nom. Vulg.—Bilimbin, Balimbin, Tag. Uses.—The common name of this tree, whose fruit is so common, causes it to be confused with the name which Linnæus gives to the former species. Balimbin is a fruit of an acid taste, agreeable when ripe, serving the same uses for food as the camia. Its acidity is due to the presence of oxalic acid, which makes the green fruit useful for removing ink and rust stains from clothes. The juice of the fruit is refreshing and is given internally mixed with water and sugar as a refreshing drink in fevers and as an antiscorbutic. For the latter the ripe fruit is eaten uncooked. In Mauritius the juice is used to treat dysentery and hepatitis. Padre Blanco says that the natives use a decoction of camias and unthreshed rice in diarrhœa and bilious colic. In connection with the subject of camias and balimbins we should mention the fruit treatment of the bilious diarrhœa of the tropics, spoken of by the French physicians of Cochin China. Dr. Van der Burg of the Dutch Indies also strongly recommends the treatment of diarrhœa by fruits; in temperate regions using fruits like peaches, pears, etc., and in the tropics, lychies, mangosteens, etc. In regard to the mangosteens we must not forget that, while the bark is given because of the amount of tannin it contains, the composition of the pulp is very different. The fruit acids seem to exercise great influence in the cure of this obstinate disease and I do not hesitate to recommend for this purpose the camia and the ripe balimbin. Botanical Description.—A tree much like the former. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets, 3–4 pairs, obliquely ovate, acute, the terminal leaflet nearly lanceolate. Flowers on the trunk, branches and in the axils of the leaves. Fruit oblong, with 5 very prominent acute-angled ribs. Habitat.—It grows, like the former plant, in all parts of the islands. Rutaceæ. Rue Family. Ruta graveolens, L. (L. angustifolia, Pers.) Nom. Vulg.—Rudu, Sp.; Rue, Eng. Uses.—The rue of the European, American and Indian pharmacopœias is emmenagogue, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, excitant, diaphoretic, antiseptic and abortive. It contains an essential oil, and rutinic acid (C25H28O15, Borntrager), starch, gum, etc. The essential oil is greenish-yellow, thick, acrid and bitter; specific gravity 0.911. It boils at 228°, is slightly soluble in water, and soluble in absolute alcohol. It is promptly oxidized by nitric acid, and is converted into pelargonic acid and other fatty acids. Rutin (or rutinic acid), according to Weiss, is a glucoside which exists in the form of fine needles, bright yellow in color. It is slightly soluble in cold water and more so in boiling water. It melts at 190°, and solidifies at freezing point, forming a resinous mass. Its physiological properties are as yet unknown. The part of the plant employed is the leaves, which owe their property, apparently, to the essential oil they contain, from which they also derive their strong and disagreeable odor and their bitter, acrid and nauseous taste. It is used principally as a uterine stimulant or emmenagogue, for which purpose it is given in doses of 0.10–0.15 centigrams of the freshly powdered leaf and 0.05–0.10 centigrams of the fresh leaves infused in a liter of water. The dry powder of the leaf should not be used because the essential oil volatilizes and a large proportion of it is lost, which is the most active principle of the drug. It is an agent which should be prescribed with the greatest prudence for large doses are poisonous even to the point of causing death. The symptoms following such doses are colic, vomiting, bloody diarrhœa and tenesmus. It is also used as an antihemorrhagic after childbirth, but its action is slow, not being felt for several hours after the administration of the drug; for this reason it cannot take the place of ergot, though it seems to be superior to the latter in passive hemorrhages. The essential oil is given internally in doses of 2–6 drops on a piece of sugar. It is sometimes used as an antispasmodic in hysteria, epilepsy and chorea. The Chinese make extensive use of this drug and it is one of their principal abortives. In Hindostan the dried leaves are burnt and the smoke inhaled as a cure for catarrh in children. They are careful not to administer it to pregnant women. Botanical Description.—A plant, 1 meter high, with leaves alternate, compound, the inferior ones 2–3-cleft; leaflets narrow, oblong, slightly fleshy. Flowers greenish-yellow, hermaphrodite, arranged in corymbose terminal cymes. Corolla, 4–5 free, concave petals. Calyx deeply divided, persistent. Stamens 8–10, free, in two whorls, inserted beneath a thick disc. Ovaries 5, unilocular, many-ovuled. Styles 5, first free, then united, forming a column terminating in a small stigma. Follicles 5, united at the base, 1 centimeter long, free superiorly, hard, rounded, rugose, opening on top. Seeds ovoid, angular, blackish, albuminous. Habitat.—Common everywhere in the Philippines. Xanthoxylum oxyphyllum, Edgew. (X. violaceum, Wall.; Fagara piperita, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kayutana, Tag.; Salay, Saladay, Vis. Uses.—The trunk bark is stimulant and is used as a sudorific in the treatment of fevers. The fresh bark is quite irritating, for which reason it is best to use bark taken from the more mature parts of the trunk, powdered and desiccated. The dose is 1/2–2 grams 2–3 times a day. Its stimulating properties render it useful in colic and in India it is used as a stomachic and digestive. Is seems also to possess diuretic properties. Botanical Description.—A tree 30–35° high, with trunk thickly set with large spines. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets ovate, acute, obtusely serrate, small transparent vesicles on the surface, spines on the midrib and common petiole. Calyx very small, monophyllous. Corolla twice as large as the calyx, 4 petals. Stamens 4, inserted on the receptacle, the same length as the petals. Ovary superior, 4-angled. No style. Stigmas 2. Habitat.—Batangas, Morong, Manila. Murraya exotica, L. (M. paniculata, Jack.; Connarus fœtens, and C. santaloides, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kamunig̃, Tag. Uses.—The leaves are stimulant and astringent, and are used in infusion (15 grams, to water one liter) to treat diarrhea and dysentery. The root and trunk barks are used for the same treatment and they as well as the leaves owe their properties to an essential oil and a bitter principle present in all parts of the plant. Vry has demonstrated the presence of a glucoside which he has named murrayin (C18H22O10); it crystallizes in small, white needles, is slightly bitter, soluble in hot water and alcohol, insoluble in ether, slightly soluble in cold water. It melts at 170°, and dissolves in alkaline solutions coloring them green. Boiled in dilute acids it splits into murrayetin and glucose. Murrayetin (C12H12O10) crystallizes in white needles, inodorous, tasteless, slightly soluble in cold water and in ether, soluble in hot water and alcohol. Heat destroys its green color in solutions; alkalies, in the presence of cold, increase it. The leaves and the bark of the plant contain an essential oil. The foregoing description of this species applies equally well to the following species. Botanical Description.—A small tree 12° high with leaves alternate, odd-pinnate. Leaflets lanceolate, almost entire, rigid with small dots on each surface. Flowers in axillary, very short, compound racemes. Calyx very small, monophyllous, 5 lanceolate lobules. Corolla much longer than the calyx, 5 lanceolate petals. Stamens 10, joined, but not entirely united at the base; 5 alternate stamens longer than the others. Anthers sessile, regular. Ovary superior, compressed and borne on a disc. Style 1, same length as the stamens. Stigma thick, depressed, apparently 4-angled. Fruit fleshy, ovoid, acute and somewhat curved at the end enclosing a seed with coriaceous, downy testa. Murraya Koenigi, Spreng. (Bergera Koenigi, L.; Connarus sp., Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—(?) Botanical Description.—Leaves alternate, odd-pinnate. Leaflets obliquely ovate, acute, entire and glabrous. The testa of the seed bears no down, and may be divided into two parts. The decoction of the leaves of this species as well as the former is used to allay toothache. Citrus acida, F. (C. notissima, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Limón, Sp.; Dayap, Tag.; Lemon, Eng. Uses.—The essence (essential oil) and juice of the fruit are the parts of the plant used in therapeutics. The essence extracted from the rind is yellow, fragrant, slightly bitter; density, 0.856; boiling point 165°. The juice which is turbid and pale yellow in color contains 9% citric acid, 3–5% gum and sugar and 2–8/10% inorganic salts. The essence is used to flavor certain pharmaceutical preparations, and is a diffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of 3–6 drops on a little sugar. The bitter rind is occasionally used in infusion as a stomachic and stimulant. The juice is most commonly used in lemonade, a cooling drink which, used intemperately in the Philippines, is apt to cause gastro-intestinal trouble, so commonly attributed to “irritation,” but really the result of a general atony of the digestive organs. Lemon juice is also used with very good results as a local cleansing application for sore throat, as well as externally on fetid ulcers. In some forms of malarial fever it seems to have given satisfactory results, administered internally. In many navies lemon juice forms a part of the sea ration as a preventive of scurvy, upon which it exercises a real and noteworthy action. The Danish navy adopted it for this purpose in 1770, the English navy followed, then the French and possibly others. The English call it lime-juice, and its preventive dose is 30–40 grams a day. Its curative dose is 100–150 grams a day. To preserve the lime-juice it was bottled with a layer of oil, which, floating on the surface kept it from contact with the air; but this process gave it a bad taste as did also the addition of sulphate of calcium, and at present the English add, to each liter of juice, 60 grams of alcohol, which preserves it perfectly. Fonssagrives says that the antiscorbutic action of lemon juice is due rather to the vegetable juice itself than to the citric acid which it contains. Botanical Description.—A most familiar tree 11° or more high, trunk with solitary thorns. Leaves ovate, obtuse, acute-toothed, the petiole bearing serrate wings. Calyx 4–6-toothed. Corolla, 4 thick petals. Filaments 10–25 on the receptacle, some joined and bearing 2–3 anthers. Fruit thin-skinned, globular, about 1′ in diameter; the rind adheres closely to the pulp. (This fruit closely resembles, if it is not identical with the lime fruit, C. Limetta, or C. Bergamia, Risso, though Gray states that the leaf of the latter has a wingless petiole.—J. B. T.) Habitat.—Common to all parts of the islands. Citrus Bigaradia, Hook. f. (C. vulgaris, Risso; C. aurantium, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Naranjas del país, Sp.; Kahel, Kahil, Tag.; Native Orange, Eng. Uses.—The rind of the cagel is the so-called bitter orange peel, the best of which comes from Curaçao and Barbadoes. It is tonic and is used in decoction and in syrup. The infusion of the leaves, 5–10 grams to the liter, is useful as a sedative and diaphoretic in hysterical and nervous attacks; the infusion of the flowers is similarly used. When distilled the flowers yield a very sweet essential oil called neroli, which is used as a perfume only. Botanical Description.—A tree 15–20° high, trunk bearing solitary spines. Leaves medium lanceolate, serrate, the apex notched, petioles winged. Flowers usually solitary. Calyx 4–5-toothed. Corolla 4–5 petals. Filaments joined or separate. Anthers about 20. The fruit, a small orange 2′ or more in diameter, the peel closely adherent. The C. aurantium verum or C. reticulata (Blanco) has a yellow pulp and the rind is readily separated from it, a thin net of fibers intervening. Citrus decumana, L. Nom. Vulg.—Suha, Lukban, Tag.; Toronjas Penins.; Naranjas, Sp.-Fil. Uses.—The fruit, which is handsome and large, and the leaves and flowers, are used for the same purposes as those of C. bigaradia. Habitat.—The above species are cultivated in all parts of the islands, and, like the variety C. aurantium verum, H. f. (C. reticulata, Blanco), commonly called naranjita, are among the most abundant of native fruits. Ægle decandra, Naves. (Feronia ternata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Malakabuyaw, Tag.; Tabog, Pam., Tag. (A species of Bael-Fruit Tree.) Uses.—We do not know the medicinal use of this plant in the Philippines. Probably it has none, but we may give those of the species. R. marmelos, Cor., the fruit of which is almost identical with that of our species and is called Bela or Bael in India. The fruit of the Malakabuyaw is ovoid and full of a mucilaginous pulp, aromatic and acid, the same as that of the Bael. The uses of the latter are the following: The pulp acts as an astringent, but it would be more correctly called a tonic of the intestinal mucosa, for it has been experimentally proved that, although it checks diarrhœa, it also acts as a laxative in chronic constipation. In both conditions it seems to operate by toning and regulating the functions of the intestine. Martin, an English physician, was the first to call attention to the properties of Bael, and according to Dr. Green one dose of the pulp of the ripe fruit, prepared with sugar and given every morning, is an efficient remedy in the treatment of the dyspepsia of Europeans in India, especially in the form characterized by constipation and flatulence. The green fruit is a powerful astringent used by the Hindoos for diarrhœa. In cholera epidemics Dr. Bose advises the daily use of an ice made from the pulp of the ripe fruit, the object being the regulation of the functions of the intestine. The Pharmacopœia of India contains the following preparations: Mixture.— Pulp of the ripe fruit 60 grams. Water 120 grams. Sugar 60 grams. Mix, and if desired add chopped ice. This forms a very agreeable drink which has the aroma of the fruit itself, and may be repeated 2–3 times a day. When the fruit is ripe, this preparation is not only astringent in cases of diarrhœa, but possesses the additional property of increasing the appetite. If the patient’s stomach is very weak, the preparation may produce vomiting in which event it is necessary to give it in small doses or to employ the extract. Extract of Bael.—Pulp of the ripe fruit is placed in a vessel and sufficient water added to cover it. It is then heated and evaporated to the consistency of a soft extract. The dose is 2–4 grams, 2, 3 or 4 times a day. Fluid Extract of Bael.— Pulp of Bael 500 grams. Water 3 liters. Rectified alcohol 60 grams. The Bael is macerated in a third of the water and at the end of 12 hours the liquid is decanted and another third of water is added; the maceration is repeated and the same process followed till the last third of water is used. Express the residuum, put all the liquid into one vessel, filter and evaporate till reduced to 800 grams, then cool and add the alcohol. Dose, 4–8 grams. The fluid extract is less active than the freshly prepared solid extract. According to Dr. G. Bidie, the fruit of the Feronia elephantum, Correa (the species that grows in the Philippines), possesses the same properties as Bael. Its leaves are astringent, aromatic and carminative, and the gum with which the trunk of the tree is covered is a good substitute for gum arabic. Botanical Description.—A tree 7–8 meters high, the trunk covered with large, solitary spines. Leaves alternate, ternate. Leaflets lanceolate, scalloped and glabrous, the middle one larger than the others. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 thick petals, linear, much longer than the calyx. Stamens 10. Ovary cylindrical. Style and stigma thick. Fruit oblong, more than 3′ long and 2′ thick, with a surface irregular with prominences and grooves; 10 or more compartments, each containing several ovoid, compressed seeds, ending with a woolly tuft. Habitat.—San Mateo, Montalbán (Manila); Arayat (La Pampanga). Feronia elephantum, Correa. (Murraya adorata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Panoan, Pamunoan, Vis.; Wood-apple, Eng. Uses.—The pulp of the ripe fruit has an agreeable odor and is edible. In India the green fruit is used as an astringent in diarrhœa and dysentery; the ripe fruit is given in diseases of the gums and as a gargle. Mir Muhammad Husain states that the ripe fruit is a refrigerant, astringent, cardiac and general tonic, and is very efficacious in the treatment of salivation and ulcers of the throat, strengthening the gums and operating as an astringent. A sorbet made of the ripe fruit whets the appetite and the pulp is used locally for bites of venomous animals. In the latter case the pulverized bark may be used if the fruit cannot be obtained. The fruit of Ferona is a substitute for Bael (Ægle Marmelos), and is used as such by the English physicians in the hospitals of India. The tender leaves have an agreeable aroma similar to that of anise and are used internally in decoction as a stomachic and carminative. The incised trunk exudes a gum which is used in India as a substitute for gum arabic and there is an active trade in this gum in the bazars of Bombay and Calcutta. According to Pereira, it was at one time imported into England from the east of India under the name of gum arabic. It exists in the form of irregular, semitransparent pieces, of a brownish-red color. With water it forms a mucilage as adhesive as gum arabic, and this solution reddens litmus paper. It is dextrogyrous and is precipitated by the neutral acetate of lead and by caustic baryta. Botanical Description.—Tree 3–4 meters high. Leaves fragrant, opposite, odd-pinnate. Leaflets, 2 pairs, lanceolate, entire, and glabrous. Common petiole flattened above. Flowers terminal, white, racemose, with 2 flattened peduncles. Calyx inferior, with 5–6 divisions. Corolla, 5–6 petals. Anthers oval. Ovary oblong, 5-lobuled. Style short, caducous. Stigma spindle-shaped. Ovules numerous, compressed, in several series. Fruit pulpy, globose, with woody rind, one compartment and many compressed, oblong seeds. Habitat.—Mountains of Angat. Woods of Catugán (Iloilo). Simarubaceæ. Quassia Family. Samadera Indica, Gaertn. (Niota tetrapela, DC. & Blanco; Manungala pendula, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Manungal, Tag., Pam., Bicol.; Manunagl, Linatoganak, Palagarium, Daraput, Vis. Uses.—The wood and seeds contain an intensely bitter principle. The Filipinos make cups and vases of the wood and allow water to stand in them 6–12 hours, thus preparing a solution of the bitter principle of the plant which they use in various stomach disorders. Vrij has extracted from the seeds a 33% oil of a bright yellow color, composed, according to Oudermans, of 84 parts olein to 16 of palmitin and stearin. The bitter principle contained in the root, wood and bark was discovered by Blunse who named it samaderin; it is a white, crystalline, foliaceous substance, more soluble in water than in alcohol, fusible. Nitric and hydrochloric acids color it yellow. Sulphuric acid immediately forms a violet red color which disappears as iridescent, feathery crystals are precipitated. (D. Beaumentz et Egasse.) The Filipino “herb-doctors” concoct an oil of manungal that in reality contains none of the ingredients of the seeds; it is simply cocoanut oil in which chips of the wood have been soaked. They use it in doses of 30–60 grams as a purgative, externally as an application to the abdomen in colic or indigestion and with friction in rheumatism or contusions. In India the oil extracted from the seeds is used locally with friction in rheumatism. The decoction of the wood and the powdered wood are given in fevers, in dyspepsia and as a general tonic. Infusion.— Chips of the wood 20 grams. Water 500 grams. A wineglassful several times a day in cholera, fevers, diarrhœa, etc. Botanical Description.—A small tree, trunk straight, the wood white and very light in weight. Leaves 4–5′ long, alternate, acute, oval, entire, glabrous, coriaceous, veined. Petioles very short, no stipules. Flowers in terminal umbels, each composed of 4–6 flowerets with moderately long pedicels. Common peduncle, very slender, very long, drooping. Calyx of same color as corolla, inferior, very small, 4-lobuled. Corolla purplish, very long, 4 straight, linear petals. Stamens 8, inserted on the receptacle. Filaments of equal length with the petals, with 1–2 appendices at the base. Anthers spiral. Ovary 5-lobuled, borne on small stalk. One style of equal length with the stamens, situated above the center of the 5 lobules of the ovary which develop into 5 future pods. Stigma simple. Fruit 5 woody pods, short, united centrally above a small base, semi-lunar in form, medianly expanded, venate, containing a small wrinkled, kidney-shaped seed attached by a seed-stalk to the superior suture. Habitat.—Very common and well known everywhere in the Philippines. Blooms in February. Burseraceæ. Myrrh Family. Garuga pinnata, Roxb. (G. Madagascarensis, DC.) Nom. Vulg.—Bugo, Tag. Uses.—The fruit is slightly acid and edible. The trunk exudes an abundant gum, of the odor of turpentine, translucent, greenish-yellow, forming small masses slightly soluble in alcohol, soluble in water, with which a mucilage is formed. The juice of the leaves is used for asthma. The sap is used in Bombay to remove opacities of the cornea. There is another species in the Philippines, G. floribunda, Decsne (Icica Abilo, Blanco), abilo, Tag., the root of which furnishes a decoction used for phthisis. This species also produces a gum-resin similar to that of the bugo. Botanical Description.—A tree, with leaves alternate, odd-pinnate, without stipules, bunched on the ends of the branches, with opposite, serrate leaflets. Flowers yellowish-white in panicles, compound, polygamous. Calyx bell-shaped, 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 10, free, in 2 series. Ovary inferior, 5-lobuled. Fruit, a globose, greenish-yellow drupe with numerous bony seeds. Habitat.—Everywhere in Luzon, Panay and Balabac. Canarium commune, L. (C. album and C. Luzonicum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Pili, Tag.; Java Almond Tree, East Indian Elemi, Eng. Uses.—The ripe pili nut is edible and sold in confectioneries. It yields a fixed oil, an excellent sample of which was sent by the Manila pharmacist D. A. del Rosario to the Paris Exposition of 1889. “It is an oil very similar to oil of almond and owing to its physical properties may be used as a substitute for the latter for all the requirements of pharmacy. The only inconvenience connected with its use is the slight one that it solidifies at 3° C. It could furthermore be very advantageously used in the manufacture of fine grades of soap.” (D. A. del Rosario.) The incised trunk exudes a gum-resin called brea blanca (white pitch) in the Philippines and elemi in Europe. Until recently it was not known in Europe what tree yielded the gum elemi, some authors stating that according to Blanco it was the resin of the Icica abilo, Blanco (Garuga floribunda, Decsne); it is not true, however, that Padre Blanco ever attributed such origin to that product or named his Icica the “pitch-tree.” On the contrary in speaking of the Canarium, Blanco states that it yields a resin called “pili-pitch.” I do not know the reason for this confusion of terms, but presume it to be due to imperfect knowledge of Spanish on the part of those who thus quote Blanco. Pili-pitch, or elemi, as they call it in Manila, is a substance existing in soft masses, slightly yellowish or gray, resembling old honey in appearance. Its odor is strong and agreeable, somewhat like that of lemon and turpentine. Its taste is acrid and bitter. The French pharmacist Meaujean demonstrated in 1820 that elemi contains two resins, one soluble in the cold, and the other in hot spirits of wine. Other chemists, among them Baup, Flückiger and Hanbury, have found elemi to be composed of a resinous substance and a colorless essential oil; the proportion of the latter Flückiger gives as 10% and further states that it is dextrogyrous. Sainte-Claire Deville found the essential oil levogyrous, a fact that emphasizes the probability of there being different products in the market bearing the name of elemi. Baup obtained several principles from it: (1) A resin, brein, fusible at 187°, soluble in cold alcohol, crystallizable in oblique rhombic prisms; (2) another crystalline substance, bryoidin, soluble in 360 parts water at 10°, and melting at 13°; (3) a small amount of breidin, a body soluble in 260 parts water and melting at 100°+; (4) another resin soluble in boiling alcohol, called amyrin. White pitch is used in the Philippines to make plasters which they apply to the back and breast of patients suffering from bronchial or pulmonary complaints; it is also applied to indolent ulcers. We believe that elemi possesses the same properties as copaiba, and that its indications for internal use are the same. Botanical Description.—A tree 30–40 meters high, with leaves alternate, odd-pinnate; leaflets opposite, coriaceous. Flowers yellowish-white in axillary, compound panicles, hermaphrodite. Calyx 3-toothed. Corolla, 3 oblong, concave petals. Stamens 6, inserted on the base of the disc. Ovary free, of 3 lobules each containing 2 ovules. Style simple. Stigma, 3 lobules. Drupe oblong, size of large prune, fleshy, containing a hard, 3-sided pit. Habitat.—Very common in all Philippine woods especially in Camarines. Meliaceæ. Melia Family. Melia Azedarach, L. Nom. Vulg.—Paraiso (Paradise), Sp.-Fil.; Pride of India, China Tree, Eng. Uses.—The root was official in the U. S. P., 1880, as an anthelmintic; it is administered in the following form: Fresh root bark 120 grams. Water 1 liter. Boil till reduced one half. Dose.—For a child 1 soup-spoonful every 15 minutes till nausea is produced. In view of the narcotic effects produced by this drug, the foregoing method of administration seems to us imprudent; we prefer to give 30–70 grams of the decoction and follow with a purgative such as castor oil. This drug is also tonic, febrifuge and astringent, and a decoction of its leaves and flowers is used as a wash for ulcers. Some believe that the leaves and fruit contain toxic principles, which may well be true considering the effects of large doses of their preparations. It has also been observed that the bark collected in March and April may cause dilatation of the pupil, stupor, etc.; this may be explained by the fact that at this season the sap is rising in the tree and the bark contains an increased amount of active ingredients. The fruit yields a fixed oil, and by fermentation and distillation produces alcohol. The root bark referred to is bitter and nauseous, if taken from the superficial roots—the part usually employed; the bark of the deeper parts is astringent by virtue of the contained tannin. Jacobs analyzed the bark and isolated an amorphous resin of yellowish color and very bitter taste. It is soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, slightly soluble in sulphuret of carbon, insoluble in turpentine or benzin. He believes that it is the active principle of the root, and produces the anthelmintic action already mentioned: the proper dose is 0.20 centigrams to a child of 4 years, followed by a purge of calomel. Botanical Description.—A tree, 30–40° high, with leaves alternate, compound, odd-pinnate; leaflets opposite, ovate, pointed, dentate. Flowers in large axillary compound panicles. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals, rose-colored within, lilac-colored without. Stamens 10, united into a cylindrical tube, expanded at both ends, the mouth 15-toothed. Anthers inserted near the apex of the tube, short, fleshy, bilocular. Ovary free, of 5 biovuled cells. Style of equal length with the tube. Stigma button-shaped. Fruit a drupe, about the size of a small olive, yellow when ripe, with a dark brown pit of 5 one-seeded cells. Habitat.—Native of China; is cultivated in most gardens in the Philippines. Dysoxylum Blancoi, Vidal. (D. salutare, F. Villar; Turroca virens, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Igiw, Agiw, Taliatan, Tag.; Ananag̃tag̃, Bakugan, Makasili, Vis.; Malabag̃aw, Pam.; Basiloag, Iloc. Uses.—The bark of the trunk, dry and finely powdered, is used in doses of 1½–2½ grams as an emetic, and, according to Padre Blanco, its effect is very certain. It is also a febrifuge, and Padre Mercado states that it cures “all forms of asthma, suffocative affections of the chest, and griping pains of the belly.” He also states that it yields marvelous results in malarial fevers, given during the cold stage in doses of 4–8 grams in water or wine in which it has macerated 12 hours. He also recommends its use before breakfast as an anthelmintic in lumbricoids, and finally attributes to it virtues as an emmenagogue. Padre Blanco calls attention to the species D. schizochitoides, Turcz. (Turroea octandra, Blanco), Himamaw, Tag., as a substitute for D. Blancoi. The Tagalo “herb-doctors” pretend that the part of the bark near the earth is doubly efficacious, for which reason they administer only that portion which is within one meter of the ground, giving it in the doses already mentioned. Botanical Description.—Tree 16–20 meters high. Leaves glabrous, odd-pinnate, petioles very long; leaflets entire, opposite, short-petiolate, acute, oblique at the base. Flowers in axillary panicles. Calyx, 5 imbricated sepals. Corolla, 5 linear, lanceolate petals united at the base. Staminal tube, 10-toothed and 10-anthered. Ovary 5-celled, each cell containing two ovules. Style somewhat longer than the stamens. Stigma thick and depressed. Seed vessel globose, depressed, somewhat downy, 5-angled; with 5 compartments each containing 2 seeds. Habitat.—Batangas and Laguna. Sandoricum Indicum, Cav. Nom. Vulg.—Santol, Tag. Uses.—The santol is doubtless one of the best known fruits in Manila. The most savory portion is the center, which consists of seeds covered with a white pulp of a delicious flavor in the ripe fruit of good quality. The fleshy covering is edible only in the center of the fruit and only a very thin layer of that, the rest having very little flavor. The whole fruit is used in making a confection often prescribed as an astringent. Padre Mercado compares it very appropriately to the quince. The root of the santol is aromatic, stomachic and astringent, by virtue of which latter property it is used in Java in the treatment of leucorrhœa. Botanical Description.—A tree, 30–40° high, well known in the islands. Leaves ternate; leaflets 4–5′ long, half-ovate, obtuse, entire, stiff and downy, the middle one elliptical. Flowers in panicles. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla much longer than the calyx, 5 greenish petals, linear and curved downwards. Nectary a cylindrical tube attached to the corolla for half its length, mouth 10-toothed, containing 10 sessile anthers. Style somewhat longer than the stamens. Stigma 5-parted. Fruit about size and form of a small apple, thick, brown, pericarp indehiscent, 5 or more one-seeded compartments. Habitat.—Grows in all parts of the islands, commonly along the roads. Carapa Moluccensis, Lam. (Xylocarpus granatum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Tabigi, Nigi, Kalumpag̃ sa lati, Tag.; Migi, Pam. Uses.—The seeds contain a yellow oil, bitter and astringent, with a characteristic odor, having a taste somewhat resembling the odor. In decoction they are used for diarrhœa and dysentery, on account, doubtless, of the tannin they contain. The dose is 1–2 seeds dried, pounded and infused with 200 grams of sweetened water. The bark, also bitter, is said to be useful in fevers. In America they extract an oil from the species of the C. Guianensis, Aubl., with which the negroes anoint themselves to keep away stinging insects. Wood soaked in this oil is also proof against insects. Botanical Description.—This tree, 20° high, grows in swampy districts. Leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate. Two pairs of wedge-shaped leaflets, entire and glabrous. Petiole very short. Calyx inferior, 4–5-toothed. Corolla, 4–5 concave petals, slightly notched at the end. Nectary notched, ovate, 8–9-toothed. No filaments. Anthers equal in number to the teeth of the nectary and inserted between them. Ovary very thick, globose. Stigma shield-shaped. Drupe globose, resembling a very large orange, 5 chambers, each containing 1, 2 or more seeds, convex on one side and concave on the other, angular and much crowded. Testa hard and porous. Habitat.—Common throughout the Archipelago. Cedrela Toona, Roxb. (C. odorata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kalantas, Tag., Pam.; Lanigpa, Vis. Uses.—The infusion of the flowers is antispasmodic. The trunk bark is an excellent astringent, and Dr. Waitz recommends it in extract as a treatment for infantile diarrhœa, for which I also have found it very useful. Blume says that it contains marked antispasmodic virtues, and Dr. G. Kennedy confirms it. Other physicians of India, among them Ros and Newton, have recommended the bark as a substitute for cinchona, given dry in doses of 30 grams. Infusion.— Bark dry, pounded 30 grams. Water 150 grams. Filter and add: Syrup of cinnamon 20 grams. Dose.—Several dessert-spoonfuls a day. The powdered bark is very useful as an application to indolent ulcers which it instantly deodorizes; like powdered quinine it is used in the treatment of superficial gangrene. Botanical Description.—A large tree. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets oval, lanceolate, acuminate, entire, glabrous, 5–6 pairs. Flowers yellow, in terminal panicles. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 oblong petals. Stamens 5, free, inserted on the apex of a disk. Ovaries sessile, 5 many-ovuled cells. Style short. Stigma on a disk. Seed vessel coriaceous, 5 compartments, septicidal, 5-valved. Seeds compressed, pendulous, prolonged in a membranous wing. Habitat.—Very common in the islands. Celastraceæ. Staff-Tree Family. Celastrus paniculata, Willd. (C. alnifolia, DC.; C. Rothiana, Roem.; Diosma serrata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Bilogo, Tag. Uses.—I am not acquainted with the medicinal uses of this plant in the Philippines. In India, by means of a primitive system of distillation, they extract from the seeds a dark-colored oil of empyreumatic odor, which under the name of Oleum nigrum was once proclaimed by Dr. Herklots as the sovereign remedy for beriberi. This oil in doses of 10–15 drops a day is a very powerful stimulant, the action of which is manifested by profuse perspiration several hours after its administration. Malcolmson reports that it has given him good results in several cases of beriberi, particularly in recent cases and those in which nervous and paralytic symptoms predominated. In Concan, the juice of the leaves is given in doses of 30 grams as an antidote for opium. The bruised seeds made into a paste with cow urine are used locally in treatment of itch. They are also used in the treatment of leprosy, gout, rheumatism, and other diseases which according to their medical theories, are derived from “cold humors.” For these purposes they give the seeds internally, beginning with one and increasing daily until 50 are taken. At the same time they make external applications of the oil or of another compound prepared in the following way: Place in an open pot with one opening, seeds of C. paniculata, cloves, benzoin, nutmeg and mace. The pot having been previously heated, is covered with another, inverted over the opening. On the sides of the latter a thick black oil condenses which Herklots very appropriately named Oleum nigrum. Botanical Description.—A climbing shrub, 6–9° high, without spines. Leaves 6–7′ long by 5′ broad, alternate, petiolate, entire, glabrous, half-ovate. Flowers small and paniculate. Calyx, 5 divisions. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, inserted in a disc. Anthers oblong. Ovary 3-celled. Stigma 3-lobulate. Style short. Seed vessel the size of a pea, globose, 3-celled, loculicidal, with pulpy seeds. Habitat.—Tayabas, Laguna, Ilocos North, San Mateo, Albay. Flowers in April. Rhamnaceæ. Buckthorn Family. Zizyphus Jujuba, Lam. (Rhamnus Jujuba, L. & Blanco; Z. Mauritania, Wall.) Nom. Vulg.—Manzanitas, Sp.-Fil.; Jujube Fruit, Eng. Uses.—The small fruit known commonly as manzanitas has an agreeable taste, although ordinarily offered for sale before they are quite ripe. They are among the most popular dainties at the fairs and festivals in the provinces of Manila and are the only part of the plant used in medicine. They possess emollient qualities and are official in the codex. They enter in the composition of the so-called pectoral remedies (composed of equal parts of figs, dates, Corinthian raisins and manzanitas). Botanical Description.—A shrub, with hooked thorns, leaves alternate, petiolate, coriaceous, entire, 3-nerved, 2 thorny stipules, one of them crooked. Flowers small, greenish, axillary. Calyx, 5 oval divisions. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, free. Ovary bilocular, situated on the disc. Styles 2–3, divergent; small papillary stigmas. Drupe pulpy, globose, resembling a crab-apple in size and taste, enclosing a hard, 2-celled seed. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the islands. Rhamnus Wightii, W. & Arn. (Ceanothus Wightiana, Wall.; R. Carolianus, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kabatiti, Tag. Uses.—The dried trunk bark is the part employed in medicine. Hooper analyzed it in 1888 and found a crystalline principle (0.47%), a brown resin (0.85), a red resin (1.15), a bitter principle (1.23), sugar, starch, calcium, oxalate, etc. As the active principles exist in the resins, an alcoholic tincture of the latter is the best preparation for administration. In India it is used as a tonic and an astringent. Botanical Description.—A small tree that grows near the sea coast. Trunk 9–12° high, straight, many-branched, devoid of thorns. Leaves alternate, ovate, acutely serrate, glabrous, short-petioled. Flowers greenish-white, axillary, perfect. Calyx 5-toothed, inversely conical. Corolla, 5 petals, smaller than the teeth of the calyx, oval, without claws, notched at the apex. Disc fleshy, smooth, slightly concave. Stamens 5, hidden within the petals. Filaments flattened. Anthers rounded. Ovary fleshy, inserted at the bottom of the calyx tube. Style short. Stigmas 3, divergent. Fruit oval, its base adherent to the calyx, 3 seeds. Habitat.—Batangas. Blooms in July and October. Anacardiaceæ. Cashew Family. Mangifera Indica, L. Nom. Vulg.—Manga. Uses.—The dried and pulverized kernel of the seed is used as an anthelmintic in doses of 1½–2 grams both in India and Brazil. The same preparation is used in the Philippines in the treatment of dysentery and diarrhœa and its effect is doubtless due to the large quantity of tannin it contains. It is administered as follows: The pounded kernels of 20–25 seeds are brought to a boil in 2 bottles (sic) of water. When the liquid has evaporated a third, it is removed from the fire, cooled, decanted, and again placed on the fire after adding three to four hundred grams of sugar. This time it is allowed to boil till reduced to one bottle. The dose is 50–60 grams 2–3 times a day. Incisions in the trunk exude a brownish resin which solidifies in the air, is slightly acrid, bitter, dissolves in alcohol and partially in water. In Malabar it is given internally in the treatment of diarrhœa and dysentery, mixing it with white of egg and opium. But the curative value of the combination is more likely due to the albumen and opium than to the resin. Dissolved in lemon juice it is a useful application in the itch. The trunk bark is astringent and is employed in decoction as a wash for ulcers and eczema and as an injection in leucorrhœa. The fruit is one of the most highly prized in the Philippines, and resident Europeans are able to eat large quantities of it without ill effects unless the fruit is over-ripe, in which case it often causes transient diarrhœa, which should be treated with a mild purge. In Mauritius the following compound powder is used in dysentery: Dried slices of manga fruit 30 grams. Dried manga kernels 60 grams. Plantain seeds 15 grams. Dried ginger 8 grams. Gum arabic 15 grams. Pulverize each ingredient separately; add powdered candy sugar 30 grams. Mix. Dose.—For an adult one dessert-spoonful every 4 hours; may be given in cauge or arrowroot. The flowers, testa and bark are, in Hindoo therapeutics, considered “cold,” and “astringent,” and are used especially in diarrhœa. In certain throat affections the Hindoos employ the burning leaves for inhalation. They also use the gum made by evaporating the juice of the ripe fruit, as a confection and an antiscorbutic. Dr. Linguist recommends the bark as a local astringent in uterine, intestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage and employs the following: Fluid Extract.— Fluid extract of manga bark 10 grams. Water 120 grams. Mix. Dose, 1 teaspoonful every 1 or 2 hours. Botanical Description.—A noble tree, 30° to 40° high, dome-like or rotund in outline. Leaves dark green, lustrous, alternate, lanceolate, entire; short petioles. Flowers racemose, in verticillate panicles. Calyx, 4, 5 or 6 sepals. Corolla white, fragrant, 4, 5 or 6 petals. Stamens 5, of which perhaps 1, 2 or 3 are fertile. Style on one side of the ovary. Stigma simple. Fruit large, reniform, fleshy, yellow when ripe; contains a large, flattened, reniform pit. Blooms from January even till June. The natives force the fruit by building fires under the trees when but little air is stirring. Habitat.—Common throughout the islands. Anacardium occidentale, L. (Cassuvium reniforme, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kasuy, Tag.; Caskew Nut, Eng. Uses.—The pericarp of the nut contains an essential oil which is very irritant and used by the Hindoos as a vesicant; it severely blisters the lips and tongues of imprudent persons who break the nut without taking the precaution of cleansing it of the oil before opening it. In addition to the oil called cardol, the pericarp contains an especial acid anacardic, a little tannin and ammonia. Cardol (C21H31O2) is an oleaginous, yellow liquid very unstable, neutral, soluble in alcohol and ether, insoluble in water, volatile, and vesicant if applied to the skin. “Anacardic” acid is white, crystalline, odorless, with a burning, aromatic taste. It melts at 26° and decomposes at 200° forming a colorless oil; it is not vesicant, burns with a dark flame, and has the odor of rancid oil. A tincture of the pericarp has been made (1 part to 10 of alcohol) and given internally as a vermifuge in doses of 2–10 drops. Cardol, according to some authors, does not exercise a vesicant action in the gastro-intestinal canal, because it is not dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices; I am sure, however, that I have seen a choleraic diarrhœa brought on by swallowing, in fun, the pericarp of one nut and a half. Cardol is eliminated by the urine. The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste when roasted. By expression it yields a sweet, yellowish oil, density 0.916. The trunk exudes a gum resin in masses varying in color from red to yellow. The fleshy part, called the fruit, is edible but contains a certain quantity of cardol not only evidenced by the odor but by the smarting of the mouth and throat after eating. It is very juicy and the expressed liquid is fermented in Bombay and distilled to make a very weak alcohol which sells for the very low price of 4 annas (5 cents gold) a gallon. This alcohol is again distilled and a stronger obtained which sells for 1½ rupees a gallon. The Portuguese of India make a sort of wine from the fermented juice of the fruit, which, like the weak alcohol we have mentioned, is a well-known diuretic and is used as a liniment. The gum resin of the trunk contains 90% of anacardic acid and 10% cardol. Wood soaked in it is preserved from the ravages of insects, especially of white ants, for which purpose it is used by bookbinders also. Therapeutically it is used externally in leprosy, old ulcers and to destroy corns, but on account of its rubefacient and vesicant qualities it is necessary to use it cautiously. Botanical Description.—A tree, 18° high, with leaves cuneiform, glabrous, stiff, short-petioled. Flowers polygamous in terminal panicles. Calyx with 5 erect segments, imbricated, caducous. Corolla, 5 linear, lanceolate petals, curved and imbricated. Stamens 8–10, all fertile. Filaments united to one another and to the disc. Ovary heart-shaped. Style filiform and eccentric. Stigma defective. Ovule solitary. Fruit a reniform nut enclosed in a pulpy pyriform body, formed by the matured disc and extremity of the peduncle. Seed reniform, testa membranous. Habitat.—Common throughout the Archipelago. Blooms in February. Odina Wodier, Roxb. Nom. Vulg.—Amugis, Tag. and Vis. Uses.—The bark is very astringent and in decoction is used for chronic ulcers. In India Dr. Kirkpatrick has used it as a lotion in impetigo. It has also given good results as a gargle in affections of the pharynx and buccal cavity. The trunk exudes a gum called in India “kanni ki gond,” an article of commerce. It is almost odorless and has a disagreeable taste. It is only partially soluble in water, forming a viscid mucilage. It is used in the treatment of contusions and sprains and is edible when mixed with cocoanut milk. Botanical Description.—A tree, with leaves bunched at the extremities of the branches, oblong, oval, acuminate, odd-pinnate, 3–4 pairs of opposite leaflets. Flowers greenish-white, polygamous, in terminal panicles. Calyx gamosepalous, 4 rounded lobules. Corolla, 4 imbricated petals. Stamens 8, free. Ovary 4-parted. Pistillate flowers; ovary sessile, oblong, unilocular. Style 4-parted, thick. Drupe oblong, compressed, unicellular. Testa hard, with 1 non-albuminous kernel. Habitat.—San Mateo. Moringeæ. Moringa pterygosperma, Gaertn. (M. oleifera, Lamk.; M. poligona, DC.; Guilandina Moringa, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Malug̃ay, Kamalug̃ay, Kalug̃ay, Tag.; Dool, Malug̃it, Vis. and Pam.; Horse Radish Tree, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The root is vesicant and the Filipinos bruise it and use it for sinapisms. I have often observed, however, that it is quite painful used in this way. Dr. Waitz states that it is a good plan to add a few drops of the root juice to mustard sinapisms, a proceeding which seems to me superfluous, especially in the case of children as he advises it. The Bengal pharmacopœia contains the following official preparations: Compound Spirit.— Small pieces of moringa root } Orange peel} āā 600 grams. Nutmeg 20 grams. Spirit of wine 4½ liters. Water 1 liter. Mix and distil 4 liters. Dose.—8–30 cc. as a stimulant and diuretic. Compound Infusion.— Moringa root, small pieces, bruised} Mustard seed} āā 30 grams. Boiling water ½ liter. Let stand 2 hours, filter and add compound spirit. 30 grams. Dose.—30–60 grams a day, as a strong stimulant. The expressed seeds yield a fixed oil, which is irritating and in my opinion should not be used internally. The green pods, the flowers and the tender shoots of the leaves are eaten stewed. The juice of the leaves is given internally in India, as an emetic, in doses of 30 grams. Botanical Description.—A well-known tree, 5–6 meters high. Leaves 3-pinnate, their terminal divisions odd-pinnate. Leaflets oval, glabrous, entire. Calyx, 5 unequal petaloid segments, imbricated, caducous. Corolla white, 5 unequal petals. Stamens inserted on the border of a disc, unequal, 5 opposite the petals bearing anthers, 5 alternate without anthers. Anthers dorsal, unilocular. Ovary pedunculate, lanceolate, unilocular, with many ovules in 2 series, inserted on the parietal placentæ. Fruit a pod terminating in a beak, 3-valved. Seeds numerous, very large, winged, embedded in a spongy substance. Habitat.—Common throughout the islands. Blooms in November. Leguminosæ. (Papilionaceæ.) Pulse Family. Agati grandiflora, Desv. (Sesbania grandiflora, Pers.) Nom. Vulg.—Katuray, Tag. Uses.—The flowers are edible. They and the leaves are purgative and are given in decoction for this purpose, 30–40 grams to 200 of water. The juice of the flowers is a popular remedy in India, for migraine and coryza. The trunk bark is bitter and tonic. Botanical Description.—A tree, 4–6 meters high, with drooping limbs; leaves long, very narrow, abruptly pinnate; many caducous leaflets, linear, elliptical. Flowers large, white, fragrant, in axillary racemes. Calyx bell-shaped with two indistinct lips. Corolla papilionaceous, white. Standard oval, a slight notch at the apex. Wings almost as large as the keel which is strongly arched. Stamens 10, diadelphous. Anthers uniform. Style and stamens equally long. Stigma a small head. Pod 1–2° long, linear, 4-sided, containing many oval seeds, separated by filamentous partitions. Habitat.—Grows in all sections of Luzon and Panay. Abrus precatorius, L. Nom. Vulg.—Saga, Sagamamin, Bag̃ati, Tag.; Bag̃ati Gikosgikos, Vis.; Kanaasaga, Pam.; Bugayon, Iloc.; Jequiriti, Prayerbeads, Eng. Uses.—The part of the plant most important in therapeutics is the seed, the size of a small pea, bright red with a black spot, hard and shining. The Filipino children use them to make rosaries and other decorations. In the distant past the Filipinos used these seeds to weigh gold, a practice followed even to-day by the Hindoos. The famous Susrutas, author of the “Ayur Veda,” recommends them internally for nervous diseases; modern therapeutics, however, limits their use to one disease, though that is frequent and stubborn enough, namely chronic granular conjunctivitis. Some physicians state that these seeds are poisonous and others the contrary, but the fact that they are used as food among the poor classes of Egypt, demonstrates their harmlessness in the digestive tract at least; when introduced into the circulation they undoubtedly exercise a toxic effect. We have already mentioned that their use is limited nowadays to the therapeutics of the eye; the decoction of the seeds known in Europe under the name of “Jaqueriti”—so named in Brazil—produces a purulent inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva and it is precisely this counter-irritant effect which makes it useful in chronic granular conjunctivitis, the persistence of which has defied the most heroic measures of therapeutics. The French oculist, Dr. de Wecker, was the first to employ jequirity for this purpose, in the form of a 24 hours’ maceration of the seeds, 10 grams to 500 grams of water. It is necessary to use a product recently prepared and with this several applications a day are made. It is now known that the inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva is not caused by germ-life contained in the solution but by an inorganic ferment discovered by Bruylans and Venneman and named jequiritin; they state that it is produced during the germination of the seeds or of the cells in the powdered seeds. Warden and Waddell, of Calcutta, have isolated an essential oil, an acid named “ábric” and an amorphous substance called abrin, obtained by precipitation with alcohol from a watery infusion of the pulverized seeds. Its action is identical with that of “jequiritin.” The infusion appears to possess considerable value as a stimulating application to indolent ulcers. The root is a good substitute for licorice, is emollient and has an agreeable taste. The extract is useful in catarrhal diseases of the bronchi and in dysuria. The leaves contain the same properties as the root and an extract prepared from them is used as a substitute for licorice. Botanical Description.—A vine, with leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate, a stylet taking the place of the terminal leaflet. Leaflets linear, entire, glabrous, tipped with a small point. Common petiole with 2 awl-shaped stipules at the base. Flowers in small racemes. Calyx gamosepalous, caducous, 4–5 short teeth. Corolla papilionaceous, wings horizontal. Stamens 9, monadelphous with bilocular anthers. Style very short. Stigma globose. Pod 4–5 cm. long, truncate at the ends, with 5–6 red seeds, each with a black spot. Habitat.—Common in all mountainous regions of the islands. Grows near houses and roads. Mucuna pruriens, DC. (M. prurita, Hook.; M. utilis, Wall.; Dolichos pruriens, L.; Carpopogon pruriens, Roxb.) Nom. Vulg.—Nipay, Lipay, Vis. Uses.—The pods are official as an anthelmintic in the Pharmacopœia of India. They are used in the form of an electuary triturated to the proper consistency with honey or syrup. The dose for adults is one soupspoonful, and for children a teaspoonful, given every morning for 3–4 consecutive days. The last day a purge is given to expel the lumbricoids. Botanical Description.—A vine with ternate leaves. Flowers red, keel larger than the standard and wings. Pods about as thick as the little finger, lacking transverse grooves, curved in the form of the letter f, covered with bright red down, which causes an unendurable itching. They are divided into 3 or 4 oblique cells each containing a brown, shiny seed. Habitat.—Luzon and Panay. Erythrina Indica, Lam. (E. corallodendron, L.; E. carnea, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Dapdap, Kasindik, Tag.; Dapdap, Kabrab, Vis.; Dapdap, Sulbag̃, Pam.; Indian Coral Tree, Eng. Uses.—This tree is well known on account of the beauty of its crimson flowers. The decoction of the leaves is a useful cleansing and deodorizing application for ulcers. The bruised leaves are used locally in painful affections of the joints and to abort syphilitic buboes and abscesses of all kinds. The juice of the tender leaves is used in Concan to destroy maggots in ulcers, and the powder has a similar use. A decoction is used locally in ophthalmia. The root and the leaves are used as a febrifuge in the Philippines and in India, according to Wight. In Brazil the bark is given in small repeated doses as a hypnotic and in the Philippines as a diuretic and purgative; a decoction of the leaves is similarly used. The bark contains an alkaloid discovered by Rochefontaine and Rey, called erythrin, which acts upon the central nervous system, diminishing its normal functions even to the point of abolishment, without modifying motor excitability or muscular contractility. W. Young isolated a glucoside, migarrhin, similar to saponin, but possessing the additional property of dilating the pupil. In bronchitis with dyspnœa the following infusion of bark is very useful: Fresh bark, } Freshly bruised leaves, } āā 2 grams. Water 1,500 grams. Boil till reduced one-half, filter and add: Simple syrup 200 grams. Dose: Wineglassful every two hours. Botanical Description.—A large tree, 20° high, thorny, with ternate leaves. Leaflets rhomboid, broad, entire, glabrous. Secondary petioles: that of the middle leaflet long, bearing 2 glands, those of the others short, bearing 1 gland each. The leaves fall at the end of the rainy season and the flowers bloom. They are a handsome scarlet color, large, in terminal racemes. Calyx half-cylindrical, oblique, truncate, entire. Corolla papilionaceous; standard elongated, lanceolate. Wings short. Keel very short, 2-lobuled. Stamens diadelphous. Anthers large. Ovary woolly. Stigma thick. Pod curved, rounded, furrowed in parts corresponding to the seeds which are numerous, oval, pointed at the ends. Habitat.—Common throughout the islands. Blooms in February. Clitoria ternatea, L. Nom. Vulg.—Kolokantig̃, Pakingag̃, Tag.; Kolokatig̃, Vis.; Butterfly-pea, Eng. Uses.—The pounded seeds mixed with oil are used locally for painful joints. They possess purgative and emetic properties and Dr. J. Shartt has employed a mixture of the powdered roasted seeds, 8 grams, with double the quantity of acid tartrate of potassium. Its action is gentle, but sure. The alcoholic extract of the root, a soft, brown, resinous substance with an odor recalling that of jalap, is a very active cathartic, producing sharp effects in doses of 30–60 centigrams; in fact it produces such severe tenesmus that its use in such doses should not be recommended. The root bark is used internally in an infusion (4–8 grams to 1 liter of water) as an emollient in irritability of the bladder and urethra and has been recommended for such a purpose by Mooden Sheriff. It is a diuretic which frequently acts as a purgative, a fact that is not surprising in view of the above-mentioned properties of the alcoholic extract. The roasted seeds used as a purgative are so trustworthy that they deserve the further attention of physicians. Botanical Description.—A vine very well known by its blue flowers. Leaves alternate with 3 pairs of oval leaflets. Stipules persistent. Flowers axillary, solitary, 1–1½′ in long diameter. Calyx in 5 acute divisions, the two upper ones smaller. Corolla papilionaceous. Standard open, notched at the end. Keel shorter than the wings and covered by them. Stamens 10, 9 united and 1 free. Stigma downy, thick. Pod full of short hairs, with more than 6 surrounded with a tow-like substance, reniform, with black spots. Habitat.—Common along the roads and in gardens. Flowers in July and November. 1. Pterocarpus santalinus, L.5 Nom. Vulg.—Narra, Naga, Tag.; Apalit, Daytanag, Pam.; Red Saunders or Red Sandalwood Tree, Eng. 2. P. Indicus, Willd. (P. pallidus, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Asana, Tag.; Naga, Vis. 3. P. erinaceus, Poir. (P. echinatus, Pers. & DC.) Nom. Vulg.—Asana, Narra, Tag. Uses.—The wood of the first is the so-called “red sandalwood.” It is used for building purposes and, in medicine, as an astringent. In decoction it is used as a gargle for sore throat. The second is also an excellent building material and is used medicinally for its astringent properties. A decoction of sufficient strength to color the water a light blue is used as a mouth wash in toothache and has some reputation as a solvent of vesical calculi. All three species yield a resin known in pharmacy under the name of “kino.” The true gum kino is really produced by the P. marsupium, Roxb., but the Philippine product, especially that of the second and third species, has for a long time been exported to Europe under the name of “red astringent gum” or “kino.” This name is given to the sap of these trees dried without the aid of artificial heat. The bark is the part which produces it and the following extractive process is employed in Madras: a vertical incision is made in the trunk and lateral incisions perpendicular to it and a receptacle is placed at the foot of the tree. This soon fills and when the gum is sufficiently dried by air and sun it is packed in boxes and exported. In respect to appearance, solubility and chemical composition, Flückiger and Hanbury were unable to discover any difference between the kino of P. marsupium, Roxb., and that of P. erinaceus, Poir. It is therefore interesting to consider a product that is identical with that described in the pharmacopœias as produced by the P. marsupium, Roxb., though the latter does not grow in the Philippines. Kino is at present used but little in therapeutics and its action is analogous to that of tannin and catechu. It is given internally for its astringent effect in chronic diarrhœa, leucorrhœa, blenorrhœa and hemorrhages. The dose of the powder is 1–4 grams, and of the alcoholic tincture, containing 20 parts kino to 100 of alcohol, 5–10 grams. In prolapse of the rectum and anal fissure the following solution is used by enema: Kino 3 grams. Water 500 grams. For vaginal injections a solution of 20 to 250 water. Botanical Description.—The “pterocarpus,” L., is a tree of the first order with odd-pinnate leaves. Leaflets alternate and coriaceous. Flowers yellow, in racemes, with caducous bracts and bractlets. Calyx turbinate, with short teeth. Petals exserted, markedly unguiculate. Standard and wings curled. Keel obtuse with its petals slightly or not at all coherent. The staminal tube, cleft above and below or above only. Stamens superior, often almost, and at times entirely, free. Anthers versatile. Ovary pedunculate, with 2 ovules. Style curved. Stigma terminal. Pod orbicular, smooth or spiny, usually containing one seed, encircled by a broad, rigid wing, the point curved downward. Habitat.—In the mountains of Luzon, Panay and Mindoro. Blooms in March. Pongamia glabra, Vent. (Robinia mitis, L.; Gadelupa maculata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Balikbalik, Tag.; Butog̃, Vis. Uses.—The oil expressed from the seeds is used in India for lighting purposes, and in addition is of notable therapeutic value. It is an excellent local remedy for the itch, for herpes and especially for pityriasis versicolor, used alone or emulsified with lemon juice. In stubborn cases Dymock recommends the addition of oil of hydrocarpus, camphor and powdered sulphur. Dr. Gibson states that he knows of no plant in the vegetable kingdom possessing more notable curative properties in itch, herpes and other cutaneous diseases than the plant under consideration. It is also used as an embrocation in articular rheumatism. The powdered leaves mixed with common salt and pepper are given internally with a little milk, as a remedy for leprosy. The juice of the root makes a useful wash for gangrenous ulcers and a good injection for fistula. Botanical Description.—A tree, 18° high, with leaves opposite, odd-pinnate. Leaflets in 3 pairs, ovate, lanceolate, entire, glabrous and membranaceous. Flowers slightly spotted, racemose. Calyx bell-shaped, with 5 scarcely visible toothlets. Corolla papilionaceous, petals equal, clawed. Standard with 2 callosities athwart the base. Stamens 10, diadelphous. Pod with one seed, which is flat, smooth, veined, bright red. Habitat.—Luzon and Panay. Blooms in October. Leguminosæ. Brasiletto Family. Cæsalpinia Bonducella, Flem. (Guilandina Bonducella, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Bayag-Kambig̃, Kalambibit, Tag.; Dalugdug, Vis.; Fever Nut, Physic Nut, Bonduc Seeds, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The seed is the part of the plant employed and is official in the Pharmacopœia of India. It is used as a tonic and antiperiodic in intermittent fevers and in general where tonic treatment is indicated. It has given good results in the malarial fevers of India, according to English physicians. The Pharmacopœia of India contains the following preparation under the name of “Compound Powder of Bonduc” (Pulvis bonducellæ compositus). Seeds of Bonduc, powdered 30 grams. Pepper 30 grams. Mix and keep in a well-corked flask. Dose.—1–2 grams 3 times a day. In the Philippines the powdered seed is given in affections of the digestive tract, especially in diarrhœa and feeble digestion. The same name of Bonduc is given to the seeds of another species that grows in the Philippines, C. Bonduc, Roxb.; Kamot-Kabag, Bayan-Kambig̃, Tag. The seeds are identical in chemical composition and therapeutic indication. The two principal substances contained in the seeds are an oil, 24% and a resin, 1.88%. The former is straw-colored and slightly bitter by virtue of the presence of a resin that may be precipitated by alcohol. The resin or bitter principle exists as an amorphous powder, white, bitter, not acrid, soluble in chloroform, alcohol, acetone, crystallizable acetic acid, fixed and essential oils; slightly soluble in ether and bisulphide of carbon, insoluble in water and petroleum ether. The alkalies do not affect it. It melts at 140°, decomposing and leaving only a carbon. Its discoverers, Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen, have given it the name bonducin (C14H15O5). Hydrochloric acid colors it red; sulphuric acid, a maranthin red in half an hour. Bonducin seems to be the active principle of the seeds and is given internally in doses of 10–20 centigrams; according to Dr. Isnard, of Marseilles, this dose has given as good results in fevers as the same quantity of quinine. Botanical Description.—A shrub with prostrate stem bristling with thorns. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate, a thorn taking the place of the terminal leaflet. Leaflets in 10–14 pairs, ovate, expanded, with a spine at the apex. Common petioles thorny, with 4 leaf-like stipules at the base. Flowers yellow, in racemes. Calyx 5-parted, curved downward. Corolla inserted on the calyx, 5 petals, 4 nearly equal, the uppermost broader and shorter. Stamens 10. Filaments very unequal in height, inserted on the calyx, united and woolly at the base. Pistil very short. Stigma thick. Pod rhomboidal before maturity, prickly, containing 2 semi-globose seeds with testa hard, mottled and tough. The other species, C. Bonduc, Roxb., is distinguished by leaflets unequal at the base, by the absence of stipules, and by the bright orange yellow seeds. Habitat.—Common in Luzon, Panay and Joló. Blooms in December. Cæsalpinia Sappan, L. Nom. Vulg.—Sibukao, Sapag, Tag.; Palo del Brasil, Sp.; Sappan Wood, Eng. Uses.—The decoction of Sibukao is given in hemorrhages, especially of the lungs. It is probably the red color of this decoction which originated the idea of giving it to check bleeding, and this is the practice of the native Filipino doctors, as well as of the Arabs and Hindoos. The natives of Cochin China, reasoning in an opposite manner, prescribe it as emmenagogue. Some authors recommend Sibukao as a substitute for logwood. The decoction is administered in chronic diarrhœa, especially that of children. A few cases of phlebitis have been reported as occasioned by its use. The extract is made as follows: Sibukao in small pieces 500 grams. Boiling water 4½ liters. Macerate for 24 hours, boil until reduced by half, filter and evaporate the filtrate to a syrupy consistency. Do not use iron vessels. Sibukao contains much tannin and gallic acid, and a peculiar substance which distinguishes it from logwood, brasilin (C22H20O7), which gives a red color to alkaline solutions instead of blue or purple. It is a crystalline pigment which may be considered a compound of hematoxylon and fenol. Botanical Description.—A very common tree, 12–15° high, with spiny trunk, leaves twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets linear, notched at the apex. Flowers racemose. Calyx boat-shaped. Corolla, 5 petals, the uppermost broad, short, spotted red. Stigma bifid. Pod sabre-like, woody, with 3–4 seeds separated by partitions. The wood is well known everywhere in the Philippines, being a very important article of commerce, and there is no fear of logwood being substituted for it, as the latter is more expensive, and substitutions are not ordinarily made under such circumstances. In commerce it occurs in large pieces of all shapes and forms, since the branches and trunks are cut into pieces which vary from 1/2–2 meters in length. Its color is reddish-yellow or white with more or less red grain. Blooms in September. Cæsalpinia pulcherrima, Swartz. (Poinciana pulcherrima, L. & Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Flores y Rosas Caballero, Caballero, Sp.-Fil.; Barbadoes Flower-Fence, Eng. Uses.—The leaves are emmenagogue, purgative like those of senna, and excitant. The bark especially is a powerful emmenagogue, used in some countries for criminal purposes. The decoction of the flowers is pectoral and febrifuge and is given in bronchitis, asthma and malarial fever. The flowers contain a bitter principle. The roots are acrid and poisonous. The seeds of the green fruit are eaten frequently by children; when ripe they contain gallic and tannic acids, by virtue of which they are used in tanning hides and to dye yellow combined with alum, and black combined with salts of iron. They also contain a pigment and a resin. Infusion of the Flowers.— Flowers of the caballero, dry 20 grams. Water 500 grams. Sugar 70 grams. Mix. Dose, a wineglassful several times a day. Botanical Description.—A shrub, with prickly trunk. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets 5–8 pairs, glabrous, ovate and elliptical, bearing a spine at the extremity, 3 stipules to each pair of leaflets. Flowers yellow and red, in racemes on the ends of the branches. Calyx divided almost to the base, with 5 concave parts. Corolla, 5 petals 1′ long with short claws, one petal very small and straight, the others larger, with wavy edges. Stamens 10, crimson, 3′ long, free, woolly, united at the lower end. Pistil the same length as the stamens. Stigma somewhat concave. Ovary sessile, unilocular, many-ovuled. Pod compressed, with 7 or more seeds inserted on the superior suture and separated from each other by fleshy divisions. Habitat.—Very common in gardens where it is cultivated for its beautiful flowers. Blooms throughout the entire year. Cassia fistula, L. Nom. Vulg.—Cañafistula, Sp.; Lombayog̃, Ibabaw, Baloyog̃, Vis.; Purging Cassia, Eng. Uses.—The pod known in pharmacy under the name of “Cañafistula” contains a blackish, sweet pulp, which is a mild purgative if combined with carminatives, but it produces severe colic if given alone. The urine sometimes takes on a dark color after taking it. The laxative dose is 4–8 grams, the purgative 30–60. Extract of Cassia.— Pulp and seeds of ripe pods 1 kilo. Water 1 liter. After mixing the pulp with water the liquid is strained through a woolen cloth; the material which remains in the strainer is washed with a little more cold water which is added to the other liquid and the two are evaporated to the consistency of the extract. Dose.—15–30 grams. Dr. Irving states that the root is a very energetic purgative. In Concan the juice of the tender leaves is used in the treatment of impetigo. Botanical Description.—A tree with trunk about as thick as the human body, with leaves opposite and abruptly pinnate. Leaflets, the lower ones smaller, 5 pairs, ovate, lanceolate, glabrous and rather tough. Common petiole, cleft at the base, lacking glandule. Flowers bright yellow, in long, pendulous racemes. Calyx, 5 ovate sepals. Corolla, 5 unequal petals. Stamens 10, free, 3 longer than the rest. Ovary unilocular, many-ovuled. Pod cylindrical, pointed at the end, woody, black, 1–2° long, with many circular seeds, surrounded by a blackish pulp and separated by partitions. Habitat.—Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in March. Cassia occidentalis, L. Nom. Vulg.—Tighiman, Balotag̃aso, Tag.; Tambalisa, Vis.; Western Senna, Styptic Weed, Eng.; Negro Coffee, Indo-Eng. Uses.—In Brazil they use an infusion of the root as a tonic and diuretic, 4 grams of the root bark and 180 of boiling water to be taken in one day. In Dahomey the leaves are used as a febrifuge. Thirty grams of fresh leaves are boiled in 300 grams of water till the liquid is reduced to 250 grams. The patient takes this decoction hot the first day of the fever and a profuse perspiration promptly breaks out. As a rule the effect is immediate and the fever does not recur. This treatment of fevers is more common in that country than that by quinine and they claim that it has the advantage over the latter of acting as a stomachic tonic. By adding a small quantity of the roots to the decoction it is rendered diuretic. The seeds possess the same properties and are used in decoctions of 30 grams to 300 of water. According to De Lanesan the roasted seeds are used in La Réunion in infusion similar to coffee in the treatment of gastralgia and asthma. In some countries they mix them with coffee just as chicory is used in Europe. Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen have made a very complete study of the plant and we quote the following from their works: Chemical composition of the seeds.— Water 8.850 Fats and pigments soluble in petroleum ether 1.600 Fats and pigments soluble in chloroform 1.150 Odorous material and traces of tannin 5.022 Glucose 0.738 Gummy, mucilaginous and pectic matter 15.734 Soluble albuminoids and aleuron 6.536 Cellulose 7.434 Insoluble albuminose 2.216 Lignose 32.727 Fixed salts 17.976 Lost material .017 100.000 Previous to the studies of the above authors the seeds had been therapeutically tested by Delioux de Savignac and Professor Clouet. Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen have confirmed the febrifuge virtues of the seeds and are uncertain as to the active principle since they found no glucoside or alkaloid in their analysis. The antiperiodic properties are comparable with those of quinine and have even proved effective in some cases in which quinine failed. It seems quite clear that the tannin is the active principle which is the more probable because its anti-periodic virtues are now recognized by all therapeutists. It is given in maceration or infusion, 2–15 grams of the seeds to 3 or 400 of water to be taken several times a day. The treatment causes no very marked physiological effects. It seems to act as a sedative to the nervous system. Botanical Description.—An annual plant, .60–1 meter high. Root central with lateral rootlets. Stem straight, ramose. Leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate with a stylet in place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets, 5–6 pairs, the lower ones smaller, ovate, oblong, margins and lower face downy. Common petiole swollen at the base, 2 stipules and 1 glandule. Calyx, 5 unequal sepals. Corolla, 5 nearly equal petals, sulphur yellow, concave, the posterior one further developed. Two verticils of 5 stamens each. Of the 5 stamens superior to the sepals, 2 are fertile, larger and arched; of the other 5 stamens 4 are fertile and small. Pod compressed, linear, smooth, 5′ long, containing many compressed, heart-shaped seeds, separated by thin partitions. Habitat.—Common in Luzon. Blooms in October. Cassia alata, L. Nom. Vulg.—Acapulco, Sp.-Fil.; Katandá, Gamut sa Buni, Sontig̃, Tag.; Suntig̃, Kansitás, Vis.; Pakayomkom-kastila, Pam. Uses.—This is one of the most popular Philippine remedies and its usefulness is vouched for by many physicians practicing in many different lands. Its antiherpetic properties are notable and the Tagalo name of the plant, “Gamut sa Buni,” means literally “medicine for herpes.” The natives use the juice of the leaf applied locally to the affected part. These properties have long been familiar to the Malays and to the Hindoos who in their medical works give the plant the Sanscrit name of “Dadrughna,” meaning “to cure herpes.” The Pharmacopœia of Bengal recommends cassia in the form of an ointment made by mixing the crushed tender leaves with simple ointment. This preparation is, in our opinion, undesirable on account of its liability to become rancid and vaseline should be the excipient used. Another application for herpetic eruptions is the juice of the leaves mixed with an equal quantity of lemon juice. The Malays use the leaves dried in the sun, adding to them a little water and rubbing them briskly on the affected parts, the vigorous treatment being an important part of the cure. The decoction of the leaves is a laxative and according to Mr. J. Wood the tincture has an action similar to that of senna. Dr. Pulney Andy of India states that the extract prepared from the tender leaves is a good substitute for extract of colocynth. Mr. A. Porte claims to have obtained the best results with an acetic extract of the fresh leaves. The following is his formula: Fresh leaves of C. alata 100 grams. Acetic acid diluted in ⅔ water 450 grams. Macerate 10 or 12 days, filter and express, then filter again and evaporate to the consistency of an extract. The seeds contain vermifuge principles. The activity of this plant in herpes is due to the chrysophanic acid contained in it. The more recent the eruption the more certain is the effect. The following species, all of which grow in the Philippines, contain principles analogous to those of the C. alata, viz.: C. sophera, L. and C. tora, L., called in Tagalo manimanihan. Botanical Description.—A shrub, 7–9° high, with a straight, ramose trunk 3–4′ in diameter. Leaves 1½–2° long, opposite, abruptly pinnate, a thick stylet taking the place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets 10–13 pairs, the smaller ones 1–2′ long. Common petiole with 2 horizontal stipules at the base. Flowers in conspicuous, erect racemes. Calyx, 5 free concave, unequal sepals. Corolla, 5 petals of a beautiful yellow color. Stamens perigynous, 10 in number, 3 upper ones very small and frequently sterile, 3 lower very large. The bilocular anthers open by 2 pores. Ovary many-ovuled with filiform style. Pod long with 2 prominent wings on the sides and many seeds which slightly resemble a cross with blunt ends. The C. sophera, L., is characterized by 10 stamens, all fertile and a smooth, linear, bivalved pod full of seeds separated by false partitions. The C. tora, L., bears a quadrangular pod about 15 centimeters long by 2 in diameter. Habitat.—Grows in all parts of the islands and is universally known by the natives. Blooms in May. Tamarindus Indica, L. Nom. Vulg.—Tamarindo, Sp.; Sampalok, Tag., Pam., Bik.; Sambak, Sumalagi, Kamalagi, Vis.; Tamarind, Eng. Uses.—The pulp of the fruit is used to make a sort of sweet preserve and is very popular among the Filipinos. They prepare a refreshing drink from the pulp mixed with sweetened water and believing it to be beneficial to the liver, stomach and blood, they use too much of it. Its excessive use is rather prejudicial to the health, but given in moderation it is very efficient in allaying the thirst of fever patients. The pulp contains weak laxative properties and it is customary to administer it in solution with cream of tartar. Its chemical composition is as follows: Citric acid 9.40 Tartaric acid 1.55 Malic acid 0.45 Potassium bitartrate 3.25 Sugar 12.50 Gum 4.70 Vegetable gelatin 6.25 Parenchyma 34.35 Water 27.55 (Vauquelin.) At the end of any sickness, especially after labor, the first bath given to the convalescent is with a decoction of the leaves of the “sampaloc,” to prevent convulsions, the native herb-doctors say. Botanical Description.—A large tree, somewhat resembling the elm in contour, with leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate. Leaflets 12 or more pairs, linear, with a notch at the apex, entire, glabrous. Flowers yellow-white, spattered dark red, racemose. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 5 lanceolate petals with crispate borders. Stamens monadelphous, dividing into 7 filaments above. The ripe pod is chocolate color, oblong, slightly compressed, straight or curved, 6–15 centimeters long, full of a light-brown pulp in which rest the seeds enveloped in a cellular membrane. These seeds are flattened, almost quadrangular; testa hard, of a chestnut color, shiny and without albumen. Habitat.—Very common everywhere in the islands. Blooms in May. Bauhinia malabarica, Roxb. (B. tomentosa, Wall. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Alibag̃bag̃, Tag., Vis., Pam. Uses.—The leaves of this tree and of the species B. tomentosa, L., are quite acid and the Filipinos use them as an ingredient of many dishes. The fresh flowers possess anti-dysenteric virtues for which purpose they are given internally in infusion of 10–20 grams of the flowers to one-half liter of water. The decoction of the root bark is a common remedy for liver troubles along the coast of Malabar according to Rheede. Botanical Description.—A tree 20° high, with leaves alternate, peltate, slightly cordate, orbicular, the apex divided into two large lobules with a stylet between them, glabrous above, somewhat downy beneath; 2 large, flat glandules are situated at the base. Petioles short. Flowers cymose. Peduncle long. Calyx inferior, funnelform, with 4–5 sepals as long as the corolla. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 10, 5 alternate ones longer than the others. Stigma thick, peltate, 2 lobules. Pod 1° long, with linear stalk, containing many seeds separated by filamentous isthmuses. Habitat.—Common everywhere. Blooms in November. Leguminosæ. Mimosa Division. Entada scandens, Benth. (E. Pursœtha, DC. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Gogo, Tag.; Bayogo, Balogo, Gohog̃ bakay, Vis. and Pam.; Gilla Nuts, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The use made of the mashed bark of this tree is well known throughout the Philippines. Cut in strips and beaten thoroughly between stones it is sold under the name of “gogo”; it is macerated in water, to which it imparts a reddish color, and forms a substitute for soap. The Filipinos use this preparation for bathing, especially the hair, for which purpose there is no more useful or simple preparation. It cures pityriasis, and renders the hair very soft, without drying it too much as is usually the case with soap. The natives use it in treating the itch, washing the affected parts with the maceration and at the same time briskly rubbing them with the bark; in this way they remove the crusts that shield the acari. The treatment is successful in direct proportion to the energy of rubbing. The seeds of “gogo” are very large, lenticular, flattened, 3–4 centimeters in diameter. Their chemical composition has been studied by Pettit. Alcohol dissolves the active principle, perhaps a glucoside, the study of which the author has not completed. Five centigrams of this substance administered to a guinea-pig causes paralysis of the hind quarters without any apparent inflammation. He also found saponin in the seeds, but it exists in much greater quantity in the trunk. In the Sunda Islands they eat the seeds roasted and also extract from them an illuminating oil. The maceration of gogo is emetic and purgative; it is used in the treatment of asthma; it is exceedingly irritating, the slightest quantity that enters the eye causing severe smarting and a slight conjunctivitis for one or two days. Botanical Description.—A high climbing shrub with stem as much as 7–8′ in diameter. Leaves opposite, twice abruptly pinnate, a stylet replacing the terminal leaflet; 5 pairs of elliptical leaflets, entire, glabrous and notched at the apex. Common petiole with 2 stipules at the base. Flowers in delicate spikes. Calyx obliquely truncate, 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 oval petals much larger than the calyx. Stamens 10–13. Filaments longer than the corolla. Anther with 1–2 white, globose glandules. Pod woody, 4–6° long by “4 fingers” broad, with large notches on the borders, many compartments containing many large, compressed, circular seeds with dark-colored testa, 3–4 centimeters in diameter. Habitat.—Mountains of Luzon and Panay. Blooms in May. Parkia Roxburghii, G. Don. (P. brunonis, Grah.; P. biglobosa, Benth.; Mimosa peregrina, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kopag̃, Tag. Uses.—The fruit is edible. Its pulp is golden yellow with a sweetish taste and an odor like that of violets. The roasted seeds are used in certain parts of Africa to make an infusion like coffee, for which reason they have been called “Soudan Coffee.” The pulp was analyzed by Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen in 1887; it contains 60% of its weight of sugar (a mixture of dextrose and levulose), 0.98% of free tartaric and citric acids, fats, albuminoids, etc. Botanical Description.—A large tree of the first order. Leaves opposite, twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets small, linear, more than 40 pairs. Principal petiole with one glandule at the base and often another higher up. Calyx long, tubular, with 5 unequal lobules. Corolla, 5 equal petals. Stamens 10, monadelphous. Ovary free, unilocular, multi-ovulate. Pod, 1° × 1′, woody, much compressed, brown, with many seeds embedded in a yellow pulp. Habitat.—Abounds in the provinces of central Luzon. Blooms in December. Acacia Farnesiana, Willd. (A. Indica, Desv.; Mimosa Farnesiana, L. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Aroma, Sp.; Cassie Flower, Eng. Uses.—The trunk bark is astringent and in decoction is of use in the treatment of prolapsed rectum and as an injection for leucorrhœa. A poultice of the tender leaves is applied to ulcers and sores previously washed with the decoction. The tree exudes an abundant gum very similar to gum arabic which latter is the product of another species of acacia (A. Arabica, Willd.). The Manila pharmacist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, sent to the Paris Exposition of 1899 a specimen of this gum obtained on the plantation of D. P. P. Roxas, in Batangas. This specimen differed in no respect from gum arabic and it will surely sooner or later take the place of the latter in the Philippines, both for pharmaceutical and industrial purposes. It would be superfluous to describe here the properties of gum arabic. Botanical Description.—A small tree 9–12° high, very well known, trunk bristling with long thorns. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate. One or more pairs of leaflets, very small, linear. Common petiole with two thorns united at its base and a small glandule on the upper part. Flowers yellow, aromatic, axillary, joined in a globose head ½–¾′ in diameter, consisting of more than 50 minute flowerets. In each axil are 2 peduncles. In some heads all the flowerets are staminate, in others hermaphrodite. The hermaphrodite flowers have a calyx with 5 small teeth. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 40 or more. Pistil same length as the stamens. Staminate flowers: calyx, corolla, stamens and anthers as in the hermaphrodite flowers. Pistil none. Pod round, curved, with 8 or more elliptical, compressed seeds. Habitat.—Grows everywhere, but forms dense thickets in the provinces of La Laguna and Batangas. Blooms in January. Crassulaceæ. Orpine Family. Kalanchoe laciniata, DC. (Cotyledon laciniata, Roxb.; Bryophyllum serratum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Siempreviva (Live-for-ever), Sp.-Fil.; Katakatakā, Tag. Uses.—The fleshy leaves are beaten up and applied to chronic ulcers and sores on which they exert a stimulant action. Applied to the temples they relieve headache. Ainslie testifies to the good effect of its local use in inflammations and as a wash for ulcers. The juice of the leaves is used in Concan in the treatment of bilious diarrhœa and gall stones. Botanical Description.—A well-known plant, about 2° high, with leaves sessile, opposite, oval, serrately toothed, fleshy. Flowers yellow, in umbels, the stalks reaching a height of 3°. Calyx very short, with 4 lanceolate, acuminate sepals, united at the base. Corolla salver-shaped, persistent, with border having 4 small lobules. Stamens 8, fertile. Ovaries 4, free, each with 1 many-ovuled cell. Styles same length as the stamens. Stigmas awl-shaped. Four seed vessels, each with 1 compartment containing many oblong seeds. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the islands. Combretaceæ. Terminalia Catappa, L. (T. molucana, Lam.; T. mauriciana, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Talisay, Tag.; Almendro, Sp.-Fil.; Talisay, Banilak, Nato, Hitam, Vis.; Kalisay, Pam.; Lugo, Pandan, Iloc.; Indian Almond, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste. It yields about 50% of a fixed oil, sweet and savory. If left for some time, it deposits an abundance of stearin. It closely resembles oil of sweet almonds for which it, as well as the oil of Pili (Canarium commune, L.), which we have already described, makes a good substitute. The trunk bark is astringent and in decoction is used for atonic diarrhœa and as a lotion for ulcers. Decoction.— Bark (ground and pounded) 12 grams. Water 150 grams. Simple syrup 40 grams. To be given by the tablespoonful in 24 hours. Botanical Description.—A tree, 6–8 m. high. Branches horizontal and radiating from the trunk. Leaves purplish, bunched, cleft at the base, sometimes transversely ovate, sometimes oval, notched, glabrous. Petiole very short. Flowers axillary, racemose, with a scale at the base of the peduncle, some hermaphrodite and others lacking pistils. Staminate flowers: calyx downy within, with 5 lobes. Corolla wanting. Stamens 10, inserted on the calyx. Hermaphrodite flowers: pistil same length as stamens. Drupe, fleshy, inferior, oval with the borders turned upward containing a very hard and fibrous nut; seed long and sharp-pointed. Habitat.—Common in Luzon. In Manila it is cultivated extensively as an ornamental tree, especially along the Sabana Walk, General Solano Ave. and in Sampaloc and Malacañan. Terminalia Chebula, Retz. (T. reticulata, Toth.; Bucida cuminata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Dig̃las, Diglas, Tag.; Black Myrobalan Tree, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The ripe fruit, called myrobalans in India, is purgative and six of them pounded up and given in decoction operate with certainty, producing 4 or 5 copious evacuations without nausea or other disagreeable symptoms. Dr. Waring has experimented with them and recommends them highly. The taste may be made more agreeable by adding a little cinnamon to the decoction. Dymock states that three fruits are sufficient, and Dr. Hove gives one as the effective dose. This lack of agreement may be explained by the fact that the fruits are of different sizes, and probably Waring refers to those of medium size. Contrary to what one would imagine, judging from its purgative action, the fruit contains astringent principles, and makes an effective injection for leucorrhœa as a substitute for nut galls. It is also of some merit in the treatment of piles. The green fruit is highly esteemed by Radja Kalikesen as a carminative, tonic and purgative. Dr. Twining also mentions these same properties, recommends it as a tonic and aperient of great benefit in atony of the digestive organs and expresses surprise that the Europeans make no use of it. According to the same author a dose in the treatment of diarrhœa and dysentery is 4 grams twice a day. He quotes a case of hypertrophy of the spleen which he cured with this fruit. Some of the leaves bear horn-shaped galls, flattened, narrow and hollow. They are caused by an insect which stings the leaves and deposits its eggs in them. These leaves with galls are astringent and very useful and effective in dysentery and diarrhœa, especially that of children. The dose for a child of more than one year is 0.40 to 0.50 gram a day, administered in fractional doses every two or three hours. Fridolin has obtained from its fruit an acid, which he calls chebulinic (C28H25O10) and presumes to be a mixture of tannic and gallic acids. As Stenhouse had formerly indicated, no principle has been discovered to which the purgative properties can be attributed, unless it be a green oleo-resin turned red by nitric acid, obtained from the fruit by Apery. Botanical Description.—A tree of the second order, with leaves 3′ long, alternate, lanceolate, entire and glabrous. Petioles short. Flowers terminal, in spiked panicles. Calyx superior, bell-shaped, colored, downy within, 5-toothed. Corolla wanting. Stamens 10, longer than the calyx. Anthers roundish. Ovary cylindrical. Style curved and longer than the stamens. Stigma simple. Fruit ovoid, 2–4 centimeters long, 5–10 acute angles, wrinkled, with blackish, hard, compact mesocarp; contains 1 seed. Habitat.—Batangas, San Mateo. Blooms in May. Quisqualis Indica, L. (Q. villosa, Roxb.; Q. spinosa, Nares.) Nom. Vulg.—Tagaraw, Niogniogan, Tag.; Tangolon, Vis.; Babebabe, Pam.; Tartaraw, Iloc. Uses.—The fruit contains a kernel that tastes much like cacao, for which reason the Tagalogs call it “niogniogan” (like cacao). This kernel is a powerful anthelmintic, used also in India, the dose for a child of 4 years being 2–4, pulverized and mixed with a little molasses or sugar. A large dose produces hiccough, a fact well known to the natives. Dr. Bouton states that they may cause convulsions and other similar nervous disorders. They yield a light green, fixed oil, probably the active principle of the plant. Botanical Description.—A climbing shrub, 6–9° high, whose stem is thickly set with long, opposite thorns. Leaves in stars of 3, oblong, acute, entire, glabrous. Petioles very short. Flowers white, veined with red, in axillary spikes. Calyx very long, nearly cylindrical, 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 petals, inserted between the teeth of the calyx. Stamens 10, inserted on the calyx-tube, shorter than the corolla, arranged in 2 series, 5 higher than the rest. Style the same length as the stamens, united throughout nearly its entire length with the wall of the calyx-tube from which it separates near the stigma. Stigma rather bulky. Fruit 1′ long, ovoid, 5 sharp ridges in the woody, fragile, mahogany-colored pericarp, which contains a pointed kernel at one end. Habitat.—San Mateo, and along the shores of Luzon. Blooms in May. Myrtaceæ. Myrtle Family. Psidium pomiferum, L. (P. aromaticum and P. pyriferum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Guayabas, Sp.; Bayabas, Guayabas, Tayabas, Tag., and other dialects; Guava, Eng. Uses.—The green fruit is acid and very astringent. The stage of development when it is best eaten raw, is just before it ripens, for then its acidity has lessened, it is not astringent and does not emit the strong odor, so disagreeable to many, that characterizes the ripe fruit. When fully ripe it is sweet, non-astringent and very bland, and this is the stage when it is best for making the jellies and preserves so popular in the Philippines. The bark, especially that of the root, is highly astringent and a decoction of it is used for diarrhœa and as a wash for ulcers. Dr. Waitz has successfully used the following formula in treating the chronic diarrhœa of children: Root bark of guava 15 grams. Water 180 grams. Boil till reduced one half. Dose, a tablespoonful every 2 or 3 hours according to age. A decoction of the shoots is very useful in stomatitis, cutaneous eruptions and ulcers. Dr. Waitz advises his formula in prolapsus recti of children. It is also of value as an injection in diarrhœa and dysentery. Botanical Description.—A tree, about 10° high, branches square and somewhat winged towards the ends. Leaves opposite, oblong, obtuse, downy, aromatic in odor. Petiole very short. Flowers axillary, solitary, white and fragrant. Calyx adherent, the border breaking in 3, 4 or more unequal parts when the flower expands. Corolla, 5–6 petals, inserted on the calyx, curved downward. Stamens numerous, inserted in the calyx, as long as the corolla. Style same length as stamens, awl-shaped. Fruit somewhat pear-shaped, with 4 or 5 ribs that disappear at maturity, 4 or more cells each with many small, hard, irregular seeds. In the Philippines the fruit grows to the size of a small pear. Eugenia Jambolana, Lam. (Calyptranthes Jambolana, Willd. and Blanco; Syzygium Jambolanum, DC. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lomboy, Duhat, Duat, Tag., Pam., Vis.; Jambul or Black Plum, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The ripe fruit, so dark a purple in color that it seems black, is edible and very popular in the Philippines, though not considered choice. Some suppose it to be harmful, but it is in reality very easy of digestion. The syrup of the fruit juice, and the decoction of the trunk bark are both very efficacious in the treatment of diarrhœa and dysentery. Syrup of Jambul.— Juice of ripe fruit 500 grams. White sugar 950 grams. Dissolve in a covered water-bath, strain through woolen cloth and put aside. Dose.—60–200 grams a day. The juice of the leaves is also used to treat diarrhœa. A Hindoo physician, Bhavaprakasa, advises the following receipt: Juice of leaves of lomboy } Juice of leaves of manga } āā 4 grams. Pulp of Terminalia chebula } Give in one dose in a little goat’s milk and honey. A sort of wine of very agreeable taste is made from the fruit juice. Lately the powdered seed has been recommended in the treatment of glycosuria or at least it has been stated that its internal use lessens and finally abolishes the glucose from the urine of the patient. It has even been affirmed that while under this treatment the patient may eat glucose-forming foods without fear of glycosuria supervening. The chemical composition of the seeds are as follows: Essential oil Traces. Chlorophyl and fatty matters 0.37 Resin soluble in alcohol and ether 0.30 Gallic acid 1.65 Albumin 1.25 Pigment soluble in water 2.70 Water 10.00 Insoluble residuum 83.73 100.00 Dujardin-Beaumetz has tested the therapeutic value of these seeds in diabetes but with negative results. Scott has maintained that by adding the powdered seed to a mixture of malt and starch, fermentation is impeded; but Dr. Villy in the laboratory of Dujardin-Beaumetz has demonstrated that such is not the case. Contrary to the opinions of those physicians who stated that “jambul” was capable of causing the glucose to disappear from the urine of diabetic patients without concurrent diabetic regimen, Dujardin-Beaumetz observed in his trials of the drug that the slightest relaxation of the regimen was followed by an increase of glucose. Under the influence of the medicine in doses of 2–10 grams daily, at the same time maintaining a strict diabetic diet, the Parisian therapeutist noted that the glucose disappears from the third to the fifth day; but this occurred only in cases of medium intensity, whereas in severe cases the medication produced no effect. Upon stopping the treatment the sugar reappeared. Botanical Description.—A tree, 15–20° high, with leaves opposite, acute, entire, ovate, lustrous, very smooth. Flowers in racemose panicles with peduncles opposite. Calyx superior, with 5 small teeth and a deciduous cover composed of many orbicular pieces joined below. Corolla none. Stamens numerous, inserted on the edge of the calyx. Stigma pointed. Fruit black, oval, crowned with the calyx; one long cylindrical seed with membranaceous epidermis. Habitat.—Common all over the Archipelago. Blooms in February. Melastomaceæ. Melastoma malabatrichum, L. (M. obvolutum, Jack.; M. aspera and obvoluta, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Granatis, Tag. Uses.—A decoction of the leaves is of use as an astringent in diarrhœa and dysentery. A decoction of the bark is used as a gargle for aphthæ and catarrhal sore throat, and as a wash for ulcers and the itch. The fruit is edible, resembling slightly the currant; it has doubtless received the name “granatis” on account of its many seeds. Botanical Description.—Small tree, with opposite branches, their ends covered with hairs. Leaves opposite, 3-nerved, 1′ long, very rough with short hairs. Flowers carmine, in terminal panicles. Stamens 10. Filaments alternating violet and straw-color. Habitat.—Mountains of Angat and San Mateo. Lythraceæ. Loosestrife Family. Ammannia vesicatoria, Roxb. (A. baccifera, L.; A. Indica, Lam.; A. debilis and Celosia mana, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Bias pogo, Tag.; Blistering Ammannia, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The leaves contain an irritant and acrid principle that renders them vesicant when applied to the skin. The Pharmacopœia of India quotes Sir W. O’Shaughnessy to the effect that plasters made of the bruised leaves even when renewed every half hour require 24 hours to raise a blister and at the same time cause severe pain. He found it much more painful than cantharides and much less prompt to act. Dr. Dymock has prepared an ethereal tincture of the leaves and obtained with it results very different from those just mentioned; this is not surprising in view of the fact that the tincture holds in solution in a small quantity of ether, a considerable amount of the vesicant principle. This tincture has the same color as the “epispastic” of the English Pharmacopœia, causes less pain and rapidly raises a good blister, facts of which I have convinced myself by the use of a small quantity sent me from Bombay in 1891. Dr. Bholanauth Bose recommends the internal use of the juice of the leaves as a remedy for chronic diseases of the spleen; this treatment, however, has caused severe pain and is absolutely uncertain in effect. In Concan the juice of the leaves is given mixed with food to animals in heat, for its anaphrodisiac action. The fresh or dried plant is given in decoction mixed with ginger in intermittent fevers. If the ethereal tincture be evaporated a resinous residue remains that has not been studied, but appears to be the vesicant principle. This tincture should be made from the dried leaves to avoid hydration of the ether. Botanical Description.—A small plant with stem red, straight, quadrate, ramose. Leaves opposite, lanceolate, and fringed with hairs. Flowers axillary, small, red, solitary. Peduncles short. Calyx inferior, bell-shaped, with 8-toothed border, the 4 alternate teeth larger. Corolla none. Nectary bell-shaped, surrounding the ovary, shorter than the calyx, with 4 toothlets which lengthening form the filaments of as many stamens. Anthers 4-celled. Ovary of 4 pluriovulate locules. Style almost wanting. Stigma fluted. Seed vessel glabrous, horizontally dehiscent, containing 15 or more angular seeds joined to a common axis. Habitat.—It grows in the marshes of Mandaloyon. Lawsonia alba, Lam. (L. spinosa, L.; L. inermis, Roxb.) Nom. Vulg.—Cinamomo del país (native cinnamon), Sp.-Fil.; Henna, Camphire, Samphire, Indo-Eng. Uses.—This is a very popular plant in the Orient, for many races use its leaves to impart a reddish-yellow stain to the nails, finger tips and palms of the hands. There is a tradition among the Mohammedans that the Prophet once called this plant “the best of all herbs.” The leaf in form of a dry powder is sold in the bazars of India under the name of “henna”; mixed with water it gives it a yellow color, and when boiled the tone of the liquid becomes darker; the addition of an alkali turns it brown. In Persia they add indigo to this solution and use it as a hair dye. The Hindoos apply the bruised leaves to the soles of the feet of small-pox patients, their purpose being to prevent the spread of the eruption to the eyes. They also use it locally in a disease known among them as “burning of the feet.” Grierson and Waring obtained good results in this disease by making a paste of the bruised leaves and vinegar; cases that resisted such treatment yielded completely to a brisk rubbing of the feet with a simple paste of the leaf. The decoction and the bruised leaves are also used locally for contusions. The bark has been given in jaundice, hypertrophy of the spleen, calculi of various sorts, leprosy and stubborn skin diseases, as an alterative. In decoction it is applied to burns. An English physician, Dr. Newton, made an extract of the leaves and flowers with which he pretended to cure leprosy; it was but one more useless drug in the long list used to combat that terrible disease. The dose of the extract is a teaspoonful daily, given in 2 doses. The juice of the leaves is given in sweetened water in some countries as a remedy for spermatorrhœa. The flowers are given in decoction for headache and the fruit is emmenagogue. Botanical Description.—A small tree, about 12° high. Leaves opposite, lanceolate, broad, entire, glabrous and tough, the edges turned downwards. Flowers yellowish-white, terminal in racemose panicles with opposite peduncles. Calyx inferior, bell-shaped, 4 acute sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, longer than the calyx. Stamens 8, inserted by pairs on the segments of the calyx, alternating with and longer than the petals. Anther kidney-shaped. Ovary at the bottom of the calyx. Styles of the same length as the stamens. Stigma obtuse. Seed vessel a little larger than a pea, globose, 4 chambers, many seeds. Habitat.—Common all over the Archipelago. Blooms in July. Punica Granatum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Granada, Sp. and Fil. dialects; Pomegranate, Eng. Uses.—The decoction of the tender leaves is used as a gargle and wash in angina, aphthæ, and wounds within the buccal cavity. The peel of the fruit is highly astringent and in decoction is a useful agent in treating chronic diarrhœa, and locally in injections of lotions for leucorrhœa and inflamed hæmorrhoids. It should not be given when rectal tenesmus exists. The Pharmacopœia of India contains the following formula for preparing the decoction of the peel: Pulp of the fruit, mashed 60 grams. Water 600 grams. Boil for 15 minutes in a covered vessel, cool, filter and add water enough to make a liter. Dose, 30–50 grams per diem. This preparation is also used in astringent gargles and injections. For internal use the decoction is rendered more active by adding a small quantity of cloves or cinnamon. This mixture with the addition of opium gives excellent results in the treatment of diarrhœa among the natives of India and is highly recommended by Dr. Kirkpatrick. The most important part of the pomegranate, however, is its root, the bark of which is a very efficient tænifuge and the most astringent portion of the plant. It should be used fresh, as drying destroys its activity and gives negative results. Many failures to expel the tænia are probably due to this fact. According to Béranger-Féraud the root gives 25% to 40% of cures, whereas pumpkin seeds give but 5% to 10%. Decoction.—(French Codex.) Fresh bark of pomegranate root 60 grams. Water 750 grams. Macerate 6 hours, boil over slow fire till reduced to 500 grams. Strain. Administer fasting, in 3 doses half an hour apart. The evening before the patient should eat a light meal and take a cathartic in order that the intestinal canal may contain the smallest possible quantity of fæcal matter. After taking the third dose of the decoction the patient should take a mild purgative such as 30 grams of castor oil to expel the tænia. This preparation has a most disagreeable taste. It is better to give the “tannate of pelletierine,” a compound of tannin and one of the alkaloids that Tanret discovered in pomegranate root. A sufficient dose of tannate of pelletierine is 30–40 centigrams in wafer form, followed by a purge and with the other precautions and preparatory measures mentioned above. It causes toxic symptoms similar to those produced by curare, according to the experimental studies of Dujardin-Beaumetz and Rochenière. Its action is upon the ends of the motor nerves. A dose of 40 centigrams may cause in man such symptoms of intoxication as vertigo, inverted vision and muscular paralysis. Pelletierine should not be administered to children, but Béranger-Féraud states that the tannate may be safely given them, as follows: Tannate of pelletierine 0.30 grams. Sweetened water 40.00 grams. A coffee-spoonful of this solution contains 0.03 gram of the tannate, and this quantity may be given to a child, in a little milk. If no symptoms supervene within one-half hour give another similar dose and so on up to 3 or 4 doses or .12 gm. in all. After the last dose give the purgative as a routine. It is certainly imprudent to trust the administration of such a drug to any one incapable of recognizing the symptoms of intoxication, and as no one but a physician can judge the effects of the alkaloid he himself should remain with the patient until the efficient dose has been absorbed. This is manifestly impractical and we therefore maintain that the alkaloid is not suited for the treatment of children. An analysis of the root bark made by the French chemist Tanret revealed the presence of four alkaloids: pelletierine, isopelletierine (C8H15NO), pseudo-pelletierine (C9H15NO), and methylpeletierine (C9H17NO). Botanical Description.—A shrub 6–9° high with branches terminating in thorns; some of the branches abort and form thorns. Leaves simple, oval, oblong, without stipules, with short petioles. Flowers axillary, solitary or in pauciflorous cymes. Calyx, 4–8 sepals, persistent, fleshy, yellow or red. Corolla, 4–8 petals, imbricated. Stamens numerous, free. Style 1. Stigma thick. Fruit with leathery rind, about size of small apple, packed with seeds, each imbedded in a small amount of crisp, juicy pulp. Onagraceæ. Evening Primrose Family. Jussiæa suffruticosa, L. (J. villosa, Lam.; J. erecta, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Malapoko, Tag. Uses.—The entire plant reduced to a pulp and mixed with milk is used in India to treat dysentery. Ainslie states that the decoction is employed as a vermifuge and purgative. Botanical Description.—An herb with square stem, leaves alternate, lanceolate, nearly entire, glabrous. Flowers axillary, yellow, solitary. Calyx of 4–5 lobules. Corolla, 4 lanceolate petals inserted between the divisions of the calyx. Stamens 8, of these 4 alternate being shorter. Ovary very long, inferior, with 4 many-ovuled locules. Style the same length as the stamens. Stigma 4-lobuled. Seed vessels very long, with faint longitudinal ridges, crowned by the remains of the calyx, 4 pluriovulate locules. Habitat.—In the arable fields and along the banks of rivers. Blooms in January and March. Passifloraceæ. Passion Flower Family. Carica Papaya, L. Nom. Vulg.—Papaya, in many Phil. dialects; Papaya, Papaw, Eng. Uses.—The decoction of the leaves is used locally in sores and atonic ulcers, followed by a poultice of the boiled and mashed leaves. The natives use the cold infusion of the leaves to wash clothes spotted with blood and the spots disappear rapidly by virtue of the ferment papain which digests the fibrin. The infusion is also very useful as a wash for sores and gangrenous ulcers, modifying their appearance very rapidly. Before proceeding further it is desirable to give a description of papain, a digestive ferment which exists throughout the whole plant, fruit, trunk, leaves and petioles; it is contained in the milky juice which exudes from all these parts when cut. This juice was studied simultaneously by Wurtz in France and Peckolt in Brazil. The best method of collecting it is to make several superficial, longitudinal incisions in the green fruit without removing it from the tree; immediately an abundance of juice appears in the incisions and coagulates rapidly. The best time to do this is the early morning. The fruit does not suffer by this process but continues developing and ripens perhaps more rapidly, at the same time improving in flavor, becoming sweeter; the seeds, however, atrophy and lose their power of germination. Peckolt gives the following as the composition of the juice: A substance analogous to caoutchouc 4.525 Awa 2.424 Soft resin 0.110 Brown resin 2.776 Albuminoids 0.006 Papayotin (Papain of Wurtz) 1.059 Extractive matter 5.303 Malic acid 0.443 Peptic material and salts 7.100 Water 74.971 The milky juice is neutral and coagulates rapidly, separating in two parts: a kind of insoluble pulp and a limpid colorless serum. If combined with fibrin, raw meat, white of egg or gluten it gradually softens them and completely dissolves them in 3 or 4 hours in vitro at 40° C. Combined with milk it coagulates it and soon precipitates the casein which is also dissolved a little later. It digests lumbricoids and tape-worms and the false membrane of croup, in a few hours. According to Wurtz and Bouchut papain is prepared as follows: The fluid juice or the aqueous solution of the milky exudate is precipitated by the addition of ten times the volume of alcohol. The precipitate, after treating again with concentrated alcohol, is dissolved in water and the addition of sub-acetate of lead eliminates the albuminoids and peptones but does not precipitate the papain. The liquid is filtered and the lead salts separated by means of a current of hydrogen sulphide. It is filtered again and alcohol added gradually, which process first precipitates whatever sulphate of lead may have passed through the filter, and then the papain. Papain is an amorphous substance, perfectly white, soluble in water, insipid, odorless. An aqueous solution, if shaken violently, foams like a solution of soap. Boiling makes it turbid and when concentrated it has a slightly astringent taste. It is precipitated by hydrochloric, nitric, picric and the metaphosphoric acids. Trommer’s test gives it a beautiful blue violet color which, on boiling, changes to a red violet. It is an extremely active digestive ferment, comparable with pepsin, but superior to the latter because it does not require an acid medium, as its digestive action takes place even in the presence of an alkaline medium and of antiseptic substances such as boric acid, phenol, etc. It is given in doses of 10–40 centigrams in different vehicles such as water, wine, etc. It should be given after meals carefully and properly diluted, in order that its action may not be exerted upon the gastric mucous membrane itself. Its use is contraindicated in gastric ulcer. A watery solution prepared by macerating the green fruit has been used effectively to remove blemishes from the face, leaving the skin clean and smooth. The natives use little pieces of the green fruit to remove freckles (which they call pecas). The ripe fruit is edible and its taste quite agreeable; in some of the Malay Islands it is given for dysentery, but it must be remembered that the ripe fruit does not contain papain. The pure exudate is given to children as an anthelmintic in doses of 2–6 grams with a little molasses, but it is not so harmless that it may be used with impunity in this form, Moncorvo and others having reported cases of peritonitis with symptoms suggestive of cholera following its use. It is drastic and digestive in addition to its anthelmintic action, but according to Rabuteau, boiling destroys the first property without affecting the others. Dr. Lemarchand of the island of Mauritius gives the following anthelmintic prescription: Juice of papaya and molasses āā 1 tablespoon. Add gradually while shaking the mixture. Boiling water 4 tablespoons. Cool and administer in one dose followed immediately by 30 grams of castor oil. For a child, one-half dose. This treatment frequently causes colic, for the relief of which the author advises an injection of sweetened water. Sir O’Shaughnessy’s prescription is preferable: 20–60 drops of the exudate in a little sweetened water. This dose cannot cause any untoward symptoms and is efficient in expelling both lumbricoids and tæniæ. The triturated seeds may be given internally in doses of 1–2 grams with milk or molasses to expel lumbricoids. Analysis has revealed in the seeds the presence of a resinous oil, an oleaginous material of disagreeable odor and taste called by Peckolt caricin, a fatty acid, papayic acid and a resin. In India the seeds are considered emmenagogue. In some countries they wrap meat in papaya leaves for several hours before eating in order to soften it. For the same purpose they sometimes boil the meat in water containing a few leaves or pieces of the green fruit; some even go to the length of saying that it is only necessary to hang a piece of meat in a papaya tree for a time in order to soften it. The decoction of the green fruit is given internally for indigestion, a treatment common in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga. The milky juice is used to remove corns and Dr. Daruty offers the following prescription for eczema and psoriasis: Exudate of papaya 1.00 grams. Borax (powdered) 0.60 grams. Water 16.00 grams. Mix. Paint the affected part with feather or brush, 2–3 times a day. The same solution may be used for softening corns. Botanical Description.—Trees 15° in height, trunk covered with large leaf scars, wood soft and brittle, the long-petioled, palmately-lobed leaves growing in a crown and giving the tree the general appearance of a palm. Flowers diœcious. Staminate tree: Flowers loosely clustered on long, hanging stems. Calyx, 5–6 teeth. Corolla tubular, 1′ long, limb divided into 5 oval parts. Stamens 10, inserted in the throat. Style short, awl-shaped. Pistillate tree: Flowers much larger, sessile, in axils of leaves. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla large, 5 lanceolate petals curved outward, fleshy. Stigmas 5, fringed. Fruit about size of child’s head or smaller, somewhat pear-shaped, juicy, pulp melon-like, 1 compartment with numerous seeds, each in a mucilaginous aril. Cucurbitaceæ. Gourd Family. Trichosanthes palmata, Roxb. (T. tricuspis, Mig.; T. lucioniana, Bares.) Nom. Vulg.—(?). Uses.—Roxburgh states that the fruit is toxic and sometimes used to kill crows. Dymock states that the leaf is smoked in Bombay as a remedy for asthma. The extremely bitter taste of the fruit and rind induced Sir W. O’Shaughnessy to examine it for tonic and purgative properties; doses as high as 0.20 gram 3 times a day failed to exert a purgative effect. The root is used in veterinary medicine particularly for pneumonia. Mixed with equal parts of colocynth it is applied to carbuncles. In combination with equal parts of Terminalia chebula and ginger it is made into a sweetened infusion for internal use in gonorrhœa. Botanical Description.—A climber with broad, heart-shaped, serrate, 7-lobulate leaves. Flowers monœcious; staminate white and racemose; pistillate solitary, growing at the base of the staminate racemes. Staminate receptacle tubular, calyx inserted on the border of the receptacle, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, of which 4 are in pairs. Pistillate: the receptacle dilates in its lower part in form of a globose vase and encloses the unilocular pluriovulate ovary. Fruit ovoid or pyriform, scarlet when fresh, orange-yellow when dry. Seeds of irregular form, somewhat triangular. Kernel oily. Habitat.—Luzon. T. anguina, L. (T. amara, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Salagsalag, Pakupis, Salimpokot, Kukubitan, Halahala, Buyokbuyok, Tag.; Tabobog, Kukubitan, Pukopukot, Kuragda, Vis., Pam. T. cucumerina, L. Nom. Vulg.—Probably the same as T. anguina. Uses.—The fruit of T. anguina is purgative, emetic and anthelmintic. The natives use an infusion of the filamentous, reticulate portion surrounding the seeds, in doses of 0.50–0.60 gm., according to P. Blanco. The second species, T. cucumerina, has a wider use. In India it is regarded as a febrifuge and laxative and is commonly given with some aromatic. Ainslie notes that the leaves, as well as the fruit, are bitter and purgative and that the Tamuls use them for their laxative and stomachic effect. Drury states that on the Malabar coast the seeds have a considerable reputation as a remedy for functional disorders of the stomach. Although the green fruit is very bitter the natives of that region use it as a condiment. The tender stems and the dry capsules, both bitter and purgative, are given in infusion and in a sweetened solution, as an aid to digestion. The seeds are febrifuge and anthelmintic. The juice of the leaves is emetic and that of the roots purgative. The decoction of the stem is expectorant. In Bombay the plant is considered febrifuge, and is given in decoction with ginger, Swertia chirata, and sugar. The Mohammedan authors say that the T. cucumerina is effective in expelling lumbricoids and one of them mentions the following as a cure for stubborn fevers: Seeds of T. cucumerina No. 180. Seeds of coriander or cumin No. 180. Boiling water 200 grams. Let stand over night, filter, add a little sugar, administer in 2 doses morning and evening. In Concan they use the juice of the leaves as a liniment in remittent fevers, rubbing the hepatic region and in fact the entire body. Botanical Description.—T. anguina, L., is a vine with 5-angled stem, bearing tendrils and spattered with white dots. Leaves heart-shaped, with 5 acute lobules, spiny-toothed. Petioles with a bifid swelling at their bases. Flowers white, monœcious. Staminate: calyx 5-toothed with dotted borders; corolla, 5 fringed petals; stamens 3; anthers 3, entirely united and forming a cylinder. Pistillate: 3 glandules in the corolla tube; style long; stigmas 3. Fruit ribbed, long, the compartments formed by reticular partitions; contains many irregular seeds, one border sharp, the other obtuse, covered by a very thin aril. The T. cucumerina, L., is less common, bears a spindle-shaped or obovate fruit, is hairy and lacks ribs. Its seeds are ovoid, very smooth, encircled by a narrow wing. The reticulum within the fruit is similar to that of the foregoing species. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the islands. Blooms in October. Lagenaria vulgaris, Ser. Nom. Vulg.—Common Gourd, Bottle Gourd, Calabash, Eng. Var. Lagenaria Gourda, Ser. (Cucurbita lagenaria oblonga, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Calabaza de peregrino, Sp.; Pilgrim’s Gourd, Eng. Var. L. courgourda, Ser. Nom. Vulg.—Tabayag, Tag. Var. L. clavata, Ser. (C. lagenaria villosa, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Calabaza blanca, Sp.; Opo, Tag.; White Gourd, Eng. Uses.—The three above-mentioned varieties of L. vulgaris, Ser., are commonly grouped under the name calabaza (gourd). All have the same action and hence the same therapeutic application. The green portion of the rind is bitter and possesses purgative and emetic properties. The decoction of the tender shoots is expectorant; in addition it appears to possess purgative properties and in India is used in jaundice. The part of the plant most generally used is the seeds, the tænifuge properties of which are well known. Its action, however, is not always certain, which may be as truly said of all other known tænifuges. The seeds have the advantage of lacking the disgusting taste characteristic of other remedies of the same class; the taste is almost neutral and a little sugar conceals it completely. The dose is unlimited; some take 15 grams, others as high as 100, and no unpleasant symptoms of any kind have been reported. The only precaution to be observed is to give the patient a purgative 1–2 hours after his dose. Heckel has analyzed the seeds and found a resin which he calls pepo-resina; it exists in the greenish pellicle that envelopes the embryo and appears to be the active principle of the seeds. Its dose is 0.80–1.00 gram (Dujardin-Beaumetz), the product of 250 grams of the seeds. The dose of 100 grams of the seeds mentioned above is very small, if the pepo-resin represents the entire active principle, for 100 grams of the seeds would only contain about 40 centigrams. Botanical Description.—A very familiar vine, clammy, pubescent and musk-scented; large leaves, long-stalked flowers, white petals, greenish veiny fruit usually club-shaped or enlarged at the apex, the hard rind used for vessels, dippers, and so forth. It is noteworthy that none of the tænifuge varieties mentioned bears yellow fruit. Luffa Ægyptiaca, Mill. (L. pentandra, Roxb.; L. petola, Ser.; Momordica operculata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Probably bears the same names as the Trichosanthes. Uses.—The root is a hydragogue cathartic even in minute doses. The fruit is emollient by virtue of the large quantity of mucilage it contains, but it is more interesting for other properties. When cut in two, deprived of epidermis and seeds, and washed until none of the mucilage remains, there is left a fibrous skeleton, a sort of skein of interwoven nets that constitutes the so-called vegetable sponge. It serves the same purpose as a sponge and has the advantages that its fibers do not rot and that they are easily kept clean. In view of its cheapness and plentifulness in the Philippines the above advantages should suffice to bring it into universal use for the toilet, for surgical purposes and for cleaning in general. Botanical Description.—A vine with square, glabrous stem. Leaves alternate, cordate, 3–5-lobulate, dentate, rough, 5–7-nerved. Petioles short. Flowers monœcious. Staminate in axillary panicles; calyx bell-shaped; corolla yellow, 5 oval petals, borders entire; stamens 3; filaments short; two thick ones divide high up in 2 parts, thus giving the appearance of 5 stamens in all. Pistillate axillary, calyx adherent, 5 pointed sepals; corolla, 5 nearly triangular petals, finely dentate; style thick, short, the base encircled by 3 glandules; stigma cordate. Ovary, 3 pseudo-locules formed by the central union of the placentas; pluriovulate. Fruit oblong, terminating at the apex in a deciduous lid or cover, marked with 8 or 10 black longitudinal lines; the interior reticulate, 3 compartments with many seeds, oval, black, flat with thin borders. The natives do not distinguish between this specimen and the Trichosanthes, but it is to be noted that the corolla of the former is not ravelled or fringed. Habitat.—Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in January. Momordica balsamina, L. Nom. Vulg.—Ampalaya, Ampalea, Tag.; Amargoso, Sp.-Fil.; Paria, Iloc.; Apalia, Pam.; Balsamina, Sp.; Balsam Apple, Eng. M. charanta, L. (M. muricata, Willd.; M. cylindrica, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—The same as of M. balsamina. Uses.—The fruit of both varieties is edible, though a bitter principle gives it such an intensely bitter taste that it is intolerable to the unaccustomed palate. It is eaten raw as a salad, or cooked with meat or fish. The juice of the leaves is prescribed internally as a purgative and anthelmintic. In Concan it is given alone or combined with aromatics, in bilious disorders as an emetic and purgative; externally they use it as an ointment for the itch and other skin diseases; in India it is mixed with cinnamon, pepper, rice and oil of Hydnocarpus inebrians, Vahl. The fruit and leaves are used internally for worms and externally for leprosy. Some Hindoo writers state that the fruit is tonic and stomachic, and that it is useful in rheumatism, gout, diseases of the liver and spleen. Botanical Description.—The first variety, M. balsamina, more common than the second, is a vine with angular stem and simple tendrils. Leaves, many serrate lobules with white dots on the ends. Flowers yellow, monœcious. Staminate solitary, peduncles very long, involucre cordate; calyx 5-lobed; corolla 5 petals; filaments simple, one separate, 2 approximated; anthers joined at their bases. Pistillate solitary; ovary, 3 locules and numerous ovules; stigma, 3 bifid divisions; fruit globose, narrowing at the ends, covered with tubercles; seeds numerous, lacking albumen, having red aril. The second variety, M. cylindrica, has a downy stem, 5-angled with simple tendrils. The leaves are 5-lobuled, cordate, serrate, with short hairs on under surface. Melon hollow, glabrous, very long, cylindrical, tapering at the ends, covered with tubercles, some elevated in longitudinal lines, others depressed; seeds in 3 rows, enveloped in pulpy arils, white, long quadrangular, truncate above, encircled by 2 rows of obtuse toothlets. Habitat.—Both grow in all parts and are well known. Citrullus Colocynthis, Schard. (Cucumis Colocynthis, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Coloquíntida, Sp.; Colocynth, Bitter Apple, Eng. Uses.—The part employed is the fruit pulp, official in all the pharmacopœias as a very energetic hydragogue cathartic. It is seldom given alone, but in combination with other drugs to modify its energy and its action. In large doses it causes vomiting, bloody diarrhœa and a series of nervous phenomena that may end in death. Six to ten grams constitute a toxic dose. It operates with most force upon the large intestines and sympathetically upon the uterus. Dose.—Extract, 0.10–0.30 gram; powder, 0.30–1.00 gram. The pulp contains a yellow, intensely bitter substance, quite soluble in water and in alcohol, discovered by Hubschmann and named by him coloquintina. The seeds contain 17% of an insipid oil. Botanical Description.—An herb with long, prostrate stems covered with stiff hairs. Leaves alternate, triangular, deeply cleft in 3 lobules that subdivide. Petioles long. The color of the leaves is pale green above, whitish or gray and covered with white hairs underneath. Flowers yellow, monœcious, solitary, axillary, with long peduncles. Staminate: receptacle cup-formed, 5 sepals and 5 free, yellow petals; 5 stamens in pairs, one free. Pistillate: the receptacle globose, covering the lower part of the ovary; 3 staminodes take the place of the stamens. Ovary unilocular, uniovulate, with a short style bearing 3 lobules at its apex. Fruit globose, 6–8 centimeters in diameter, smooth, greenish, later yellow with white spots; it is full of a whitish pulp that becomes dry and pithy and that contains the obovate seeds, smooth, flattened, brown, lacking albumen. Habitat.—Manila. Ficoideæ. Trianthema monogyna, L. (T. obcordata, Roxb.; Portulaca toston and axiflora, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Toston, Tag.; Alusiman, Ayam, Vis. Uses.—This plant is edible, the natives eating it boiled, fried or in salad. The root is cathartic and is used powdered. Botanical Description.—A plant with prostrate stems, radiating branches. Leaves ensheathing the stem, opposite, oval, red-bordered, glabrous. Petioles with 2 stipules at the base and 2 small teeth near the middle. Flowers axillary, solitary, sessile. Calyx, 2 pointed sepals. Corolla, 5 oval petals. Stamens 15–20. Style simple. Seed vessels inversely pyramidal, dehiscence horizontal. Seeds numerous. Habitat.—Very common in the rice fields. Blooms in January. Umbelliferæ. Parsley Family. Hydrocotyle Asiatica, L. Nom. Vulg.—Takip kohol, Takip suso, Tag.; Rabasa, Sp.; Indian Pennywort, Indo-Eng. Uses.—Dr. Daruty, of Mauritius, has published a study of this plant, giving a résumé of its composition, therapeutic uses and physiological action. The writers of antiquity recognized the plant as a powerful alterative, tonic, diuretic, stimulant and vermifuge, especially effective in secondary syphilis and in ulcerative diseases of the skin. Lépine and Boileau used it experimentally to treat leprosy and reported favorably; but later experience demonstrated that it did not exercise any specific effect, but benefited anæsthetic leprosy simply by improving the general condition of the patient. The plant is official in the Pharmacopœia of India, as alterative, tonic and stimulant. It states that the drug has been found very useful in the treatment of secondary and constitutional syphilis, when the disease attacks the skin and subcutaneous tissue. In Bombay it is a popular remedy for the mild dysentery of children, given as a decoction of 3 or 4 leaves with a little cumin seed and sugar; the bruised leaves are then applied to the umbilical region. In the Philippines the decoction of the leaves is given as a purge. Dr. Dervegie reports good results in the treatment of eczema, administering the powdered leaf in dozes of 0.10 gram and applying locally the powder or an ointment of the same. The most marked and constant effects of the drug are a considerable increase of the urinary secretion, elevation of the temperature of the skin and profuse diaphoresis. Dr. Boileau, quoted above, himself contracted leprosy of which he died; he experimented on himself with “hydrocotyle” and on one occasion a dose of 3 grams nearly proved fatal; tetanic symptoms supervened with suffocation, palpitation, epistaxis and rectal hemorrhage, abating finally with profuse sweating and diuresis. Dr. Lépine, a pharmacist of Pondicherry, has analyzed the plant and isolated a substance that seems to be the active principle; he has named it vallarin, from “vallarai,” the Tamul name of the plant. “Vallarin” is a thick, pale yellow oil of a piquant and persistent taste and an odor peculiar to the plant. It changes under the influence of air, moisture or heat and volatilizes at 120°. It is soluble in alcohol. The plant contains 8/10 to 1% of this oil, a dark resin and a green resin. The Pharmacopœia of India gives 2 official formulæ, a powder and a cataplasm. The powdered leaf is given internally in doses of 0.30 to 1.50 grams and is applied locally to superficial ulcers. Botanical Description.—Plant herbaceous with reniform or heart-shaped leaves, forming a sort of funnel, dotted with little hairs, dentate with white tips. Petioles very long, ensheathing each other by 2 wings at their bases. Flowers 3–4, sessile, springing directly from the root, greenish-white, growing in horizontal rows on either side of a short, common peduncle. Common involucre of 2–3 leaflets. Calyx adherent, flattened, faintly toothed. Corolla, 5 small petals, ovate. Stamens 5, equal in height, inserted on the receptacle, alternating with the petals. Filaments short. Anthers globose, cleft at the base in 2 diverging parts. Ovary inferior, cordate, much flattened. Styles 2, short. Stigmas simple. Fruit truncate, oval, downy, indehiscent, marked with furrows, with 2 compartments each containing a seed inserted on the wall. Habitat.—Grows in shady and moist places. Blooms in July. Carum copticum, Benth. (C. ajowan, DC.; Ammi copticum, L.; A. glaucifolium, Blanco; Daucus opticus, Pers.; D. anisodorus, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lamudio, Damoro, Tag.; Lamudio, Vis.; Caraway, Eng. Uses.—The fruit, of which both form and taste remind one of anise, is official in the Pharmacopœia of India as a carminative, stimulant and antispasmodic. It is indicated in flatulent colic, atonic dyspepsia and diarrhœa and gives very good results. It has been used in cholera, but is of little value in that disease. In moderate doses it increases salivary and gastric secretion. The P. of India contains the 2 following official formulæ: Oleum—obtained from the fruit by distillation; is colorless when fresh but soon turns yellow; possesses the odor of the fruit and an acrid, burning taste. Aqua—600 grams of the fruit ground and mixed with 9 liters of water; this is distilled till 4½ liters have gone over, these constituting the “aqua cari.” Dose.—1–2 drops of the essential oil in emulsion or on a piece of sugar. Of the “aqua,” 30–60 grams as a carminative or to disguise the taste of other drugs (such as castor oil), thus frequently preventing nausea or vomiting. Botanical Description.—Leaves finely pinnately compound. Common petiole clasps the stem at the base. Flowers white, in flat compound umbels. The secondary peduncles 12. Flowerets of each partial umbel about 16. Calyx of flowerets superior, 5 globose sepals. Corolla, 5 equal petals, with rounded lobules. Stamens 5. Ovary tuberculate. Styles 2, very short. Seeds 2, united, furrowed and nearly glabrous at maturity. Habitat.—Cultivated in gardens. Blooms in October. Fœniculum vulgare, Gaertn. (F. officinale, Allion; F. panmorium, DC.; Anethum fœniculum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Anis, Sp.; Fennel, Eng. Coriandrum sativum, L. (Cuminum cynimum, Wall.) Nom. Vulg.—Cominos, Calantro, Sp.; Coriander, Eng. Uses.—The fruit of both species has the same therapeutical application being stomachic and carminative par excellence. It yields an aromatic essential oil with stimulant properties, popular because of its agreeable odor and taste. As a rule the infusion is given in doses of one liter a day (15–30 grams of the seeds to one liter of water). The essence and the alcoholate are also employed, the former obtained by distillation, the latter by macerating the fresh seeds in alcohol. The dose of the essence, 4–8 drops on a piece of sugar or in potion; the alcoholate, 2–10 grams in sweetened water or infusion of aromatic herbs. Both plants are official in the Spanish Pharmacopœia and they and their preparations are common in all drug stores. Habitat.—Common, cultivated in the gardens and well known. Botanical Description.—F. vulgare: Aromatic, stout, smooth herb, 4–6° high. Leaves with many slender thread-like divisions. Large umbel of yellow flowers, no involucre and no involucels. C. sativum: Low aromatic herb, leaves pinnately compound, small umbels with few rays, flowers white. Cornaceæ. Dogwood Family. Alangium Lamarkii, Thwaites. (A. decapetalum, hexapetalum and tomentosum, Lam.) Nom. Vulg.—(?) Uses.—According to Mooden Sheriff, the root bark is an efficient emetic in doses of 3 grams. In smaller doses it is febrifuge and produces nausea. The bark is extremely bitter; its reputation in the treatment of skin diseases is undeserved. It is a good substitute for ipecac, having given good results in all conditions in which the latter is indicated, with the exception of dysentery. The febrifuge dose is 0.35–0.60 gram; alterative, 0.15–0.30 gram. It is furthermore prescribed in India for syphilis and leprosy and is one of the many remedies used for the bites of rabid animals. The bruised leaves are applied to the joints of rheumatic patients. Botanical Description.—A tree 20–30 meters high, leaves alternate, persistent, petiolate, no stipules, oblong, dentate, acuminate, pinnately nerved. Flowers whitish, regular, hermaphrodite, in terminal cymes. Receptacle concave. Calyx short, 10-toothed. Corolla, 10 narrow, elongated ribbon-like petals. Stamens 30–40, filaments free and glabrous. Ovary inferior, held in the concavity of the receptacle, one-celled, with 1 seed, crowned by an epigynous disc, above which rises a simple style with dilated stigma. Fruit a globose drupe, crowned by the calyx, with 10 inconspicuous ribs. The putamen encloses an albuminous kernel. Habitat.—The mountains of San Mateo. 1 A ward or Barrio of Manila. 2 In the U. S. P. and P. G. Marsh Mallow is a synonym for Althæa officinalis, the root being the part of the plant which is used. 3 Journal de Phar. et de Chim., XX., p. 3811. 4 Daruty, loc. cit., p. xxvi. 5 Official in the U.

(12, 2, '5782616312652043896_26393-h-2.htm', 3, ' The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines Dicotyledonous, Gamopetalous. Rubiaceæ. Madder Family. Hymenodictyon excelsum, Wall. (H. Horsfieldii, Miq.; Chinchona excelsa, Roxb.; Exostema Philippicum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Huligaga, Tag. Uses.—The bark of this tree has a wide reputation in India as a tonic and febrifuge. The inner layer of the bark possesses astringent and bitter properties much like quinine. Ainslie states that it is used in India to tan hides and therapeutically where an astringent is required. O’Shaughnessy experimented with it in the hospital of the Medical College of Calcutta and reported good tonic and antipyretic effects. In 1870, according to Dymock, Broughton analyzed the fresh bark and reported that the bitter taste was due to esculin, which after drying and coming in contact with decomposing organic matter is transformed into the almost tasteless esculetin. Naylor studied the bark at a later period, and attributed the bitterness to an alkaloid that he named hymenodictyonine. This substance exists in the form of a gelatinous mass, cream-colored, very hygroscopic. An ethereal solution, carefully evaporated, deposits it in the form of crystals. Its empirical form is C23H40N2; it is probably volatile and is notable for its lack of oxygen. It differs from quinoidine in that it is inactive (?) and that in combination with platinum it retains less of this metal than does quinoidine. It differs from paricine in its proportion of hydrogen, and from berberine in containing more carbon. In the presence of sulphuric acid its solution assumes a yellow color, changing to wine-red and then to dark red. Naylor extracted another principle which he found combined with the alkaloid in a soda precipitate of the latter; it is a product of the decomposition of a glucose, the formula of which is C25H49O7. This compound remains insoluble when the alkaloid is treated with ether. Repeated boiling in alcohol renders it colorless. It is bitter, soluble in alcohol and dilute acids; insoluble in ether and chloroform. Reaction, neutral. Botanical Description.—A large tree, with leaves opposite, oval, entire, acute, downy. Petioles long, flat above, with 2 stipules. Flowers axillary, in compound verticillate racemes. Calyx adherent, with 5 promptly deciduous teeth which leave a scar that also disappears. Corolla much longer than the calyx, funnel-form, the limb 5-cleft. Stamens 5, inserted near the middle of the tube. Filaments rudimentary. Anthers 2-celled. Style longer than the corolla. Stigma globose. Seed-vessel rather rough, ovoid, flattened, of 2 compartments, where are inserted numerous seeds, imbricated, circular, encircled by an entire wing. Habitat.—Angat and the woods of San Mateo. Blooms in August. (P. Blanco states further that this tree grows to a height of about 3 yards in Angat and that it exhales a strong odor resembling that of vinegar at times, and again like that of tobacco.) Oldenlandia corymbosa, L. (O. biflora, Lam.; O. ramosa, Roxb.; O. herbacea and serabrida, DC.; O. burmaniana, Mig.) Nom. Vulg.—Doubtful. Uses.—The Sanscrit writers often mention this plant as an important remedy for the fevers due, according to their theories, to disordered bile, i. e., remittent fevers, accompanied by gastric irritability and nervous depression. The entire plant is used to make a decoction, often combined with aromatics. Dymock observed in Goa that this plant could be gotten in all the shops of the herb-venders, and that it was widely used as an alterative in mild fevers in combination with “Hydrocotyle Asiatica and Adiantum lunulatum.” In Concan they apply the juice to the hands and feet in fevers, giving at the same time a dose of one “tola” (6.80 grams) in sweetened water or milk. This juice is obtained by soaking the bruised plant in water. In remittent fever the decoction is also used as a liniment for the whole body. It is given internally for skin eruptions due to excessive heat, especially “lichen tropicus.” Botanical Description.—A small herb, stem straight, about 30 centimeters high, glabrous, dichotomous. Leaves opposite, linear, green, lanceolate, stipulate. Flowers small, hermaphrodite, axillary, solitary, or in pairs, alternate or opposite. Calyx gamosepalous with 5 short teeth. Corolla gamopetalous, funnel-shaped. Stamens 5, free, inserted in the tube of the corolla. Ovary inserted in the hollow of the receptacle, 2 many-ovuled locules. Style simple, ending in a bifid stigma. Capsule rounded-oval, membranous. Seeds numerous, polyhedrous, albuminous, surface granular. Habitat.—In the rice fields. Randia dumetorum, Lam. (R. longispina, DC.; R. aculata, Blanco; R. stipulosa, Miq.; Gardenia spinosa, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Sinampaga, Tag. Uses.—The fruit is used in some parts of India to kill the fish in ponds and sluggish rivers, the same use to which they sometimes put the “Cocculus Indicus.” It is prescribed as an emetic by the Sanscrit and Arabic medical authors of India. Mooden Sheriff ascribes its emetic properties to the pulp alone, the epicarp and seeds being inactive according to his authority. It is a substitute for ipecac even in the treatment of dysentery in which case the decoction of the trunk bark is also used. The dried and powdered pulp is given in dose of 2.50 grams as an emetic and 1–2 grams as an antidysenteric. To prepare the fresh fruit for administration as an emetic, mash 2–3, macerate 15 minutes in 150–200 grams of water and filter. It acts in a few minutes and its effect may be hastened by giving tepid water or tickling the fauces. Botanical Description.—A shrub with straight, thorny stem, leaves sessile, springing from the buds, occurring in threes, obtusely lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers solitary or in pairs, very fragrant. Calyx gamosepalous with 10 toothlets. Corolla twisted, arched, cleft in the middle, throat nude, limb slashed in 5 large glabrous parts. Stamens 5. Filaments short, inserted on corolla. Style 1. Stigma bifid. Fruit inferior, about the size of a crab apple, crowned by the remains of the calyx, smooth, yellow, fleshy, 1-celled with many seeds. Habitat.—On the coast of Luzon. Blooms in May. Ixora coccinea, L. (I. bandhuca, Roxb.) Nom. Vulg.—Santan, Tag. Uses.—The handsome red flowers are used in decoction for hæmoptysis and catarrhal bronchitis. Both root and flower are astringent and are given for dysentery. In Concan they cook 2 “tolas” (13.60 grams) of the flowers in lard, together with coriander and “mesua ferrea,” add a little candied sugar and divide the mass into large pills to be given twice a day. The fresh root in the form of an alcoholic tincture has been recommended by Deb for dysentery, the dose 2–4 grams in an appropriate potion. The tincture of the fresh plant is prepared by macerating 126 grams of the fresh root 15 days in 473 grams alcohol. The plant has been used in intermittent fevers and various skin diseases. Botanical Description.—A shrub cultivated in all gardens, 6–8° high. Leaves oval, entire, glabrous. Flowers in terminal umbels, white, pink or red. Corolla tubular with limb cleft in 4 rounded lobes. The plant is so well known that further description would be superfluous. Coffea Arabica, L. Nom. Vulg.—Cafe, Sp.; Coffee, Eng. Uses.—The infusion of roasted and ground coffee seeds constitutes a beverage of Arabic origin, but now common all over the world. In the Philippines, where a few years ago the coffee plant was only cultivated in gardens, the harvest has assumed such proportions that it now constitutes one of the greatest sources of agricultural wealth. Its use is becoming more general every day and the discovery of its alkaloid “caffeine” the therapeutical use of which is also steadily increasing, has given new importance to the seed on account of its increasing demand in the drug trade. When newly harvested its taste is not very agreeable, for it needs considerable time—2 or 3 years—in which to dry completely, before it acquires the aromatic properties and the savor of which it is susceptible. General Morin relates an incident of having drunk a delicious infusion of coffee made from authentic Moka that had been kept for fifty years, of course under ideal conditions of preservation. In civilized countries coffee is an article of prime necessity as a food; here we shall consider it therapeutically under two heads, as a tonic-stimulant and as an antiseptic. As caffeine is the principle that acts upon the heart we shall consider the cardiac properties of coffee under the head of that alkaloid, so important that it may best be studied separately. There are two preparations of coffee, the decoction used by the Arabs and the infusion, used in Europe and adopted in the Philippines. The decoction forms a tonic and aromatic drink devoid of any excitant properties, but the infusion is highly excitant and should not be taken in such large amounts as the decoction, for its action may be powerful enough to cause headache, nausea, trembling of the extremities and disorders of vision and hearing. These phenomena however are not dangerous and rapidly subside as soon as the urine eliminates the substances that cause them. Infusion of coffee stimulates especially the cerebral functions and the circulation; as to its digestive properties, opinion is divided but it is more probable that it lacks them and that coffee taken after meals owes its reputation as a digestive aid to two distinct factors—the temperature and the sugar. Without doubt it exerts an anaphrodisiac action, on account of which the illustrious Linnæus called it the “drink of eunuchs.” This action seems incompatible with the fact that the Arabs, who are so much given to the abuse of the pleasures forbidden to eunuchs are most addicted to the use and abuse of coffee. The explanation rests in the form in which they consume their coffee, namely the decoction, which is free from the sedative principle of the seed, that undoubtedly resides in the aromatic ingredient “cafeol.” Coffee is contraindicated in hysterical and nervous persons, in children and in those who suffer with insomnia or palpitation. It counteracts sleep and coma, being very useful in poisoning by opium or its alkaloids. Its stimulant action is as rapid as that of alcohol. On several occasions it has yielded me marked results when given by stomach or by enema in cases of nervous and cardiac depression. Indeed it is a remedy that I cannot recommend too highly and each day leaves me more convinced of its therapeutic activity and certainty. Attention has only lately been directed to the antiseptic property of coffee though we have long been availing ourselves of that property without knowing it; this is true of many other medicinal agents, indeed of all that the modern studies of bacteriology have presented to us as antifermentives and microbicides. Roasted coffee in powder form gives good results if dusted over ulcers and gangrenous sores, rapidly improving their appearance and destroying the fœtid odor. It corrects the unhygienic properties of non-potable water and therefore enters into the army and navy ration of nearly all the nations of Europe. In epidemics of disease every physician should advise its use in mild infusion as a regular beverage. Dr. Luderitz, experimenting in the Hygienic Institute of Berlin, reported that no bacteria could resist the action of coffee in infusion. He attributed this action not only to the tannin, which is present in high percentage, but principally to the empyreumatic substances formed by the roasting. The caffeine takes no part in this action. Dr. Luderitz exposed the coffee to the open air for six days and found it free from bacteria at the end of that time. Whatever may be the explanation of its activity the fact remains that coffee is highly antiseptic, and this should be kept in mind by physicians not only because it is everywhere easily obtained and an infusion easily prepared, but because it in addition possesses the great advantage of being nontoxic. The chemical analysis of the seed is as follows: Cellulose 34.000 Water 12.000 Fatty matters 10 to 13.000 Glucose, dextrin, undetermined acid 15.500 Legumin, caffeine 10.000 Chlorogenate of caffeine and potassa 3.500 to 5.000 Albuminoids 3.000 Caffeine, free .800 Essential oil, solid .001 Essential oil, liquid .002 Mineral substances 6.697 Caffeine, the only one of the ingredients that interests us, was discovered by Hunge in 1821 and recognized as an alkaloid by Herzog. It also exists in tea, formerly known as “theine” which is now known to be identical with caffeine; both are expressed by the formula C8H10N2O2+H2O. It crystallizes in fine, silky needles, is colorless, odorless and slightly bitter. It is considered a substitute for digitalis, especially valuable as a diuretic and where cerebral anemia exists. Germain See values it as a preventive medicine, acting principally upon the heart and thus preventing fatigue; with this end in view he advises its use before long marches, violent exercise and all conditions where the heart will be called upon to do a greatly increased amount of work. Dose 0.25 gram to 1 or 2 grams a day given by stomach or hypodermic injection. Caffeine is also useful in headache, neuralgia, and asthma and as a general tonic. For the latter action it is best given in pill form, 0.02–0.04 gram a day, with the extract of cinchona or other bitter tonic. “Etoxy-caffeine,” which is caffeine in which an atom of H has been replaced by the C2H5O, exists as white, needle-like crystals, slightly soluble in water; it is narcotic and sedative to the cerebro-spinal system. In doses of 0.24 gram it is useful in headache. Botanical Description.—“A small tree that reaches a height of 8–9°. It grows readily in the province of Batangas without cultivation,” Blanco. A small tree or shrub with leaves opposite, smooth, glossy, rich green, oval, edges fluted. Flowers fragrant, white, growing in small clusters in the axils of the leaves. Calyx 4–5-toothed. Corolla short-tubed with 4–5 spreading lobes of about the same length. Berry red, containing two plano-convex seeds enveloped in arils. The plant is widely cultivated in gardens. It finds ideal conditions for growth in some of the hilly and mountainous regions of Luzon, notably in Benguet and Batangas. Morinda citrifolia, L.; variety: bracteata, Hoock, Jr. (M. ligulata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Bankundo, Pankundo, Bag̃kuro, Nino, Kulit, Tumbog̃aso, Lino, Mambog, Takpus, Tag. and Vis.; Taliantar, Pam.; Apalot, Iloc.; Indian Mulberry, Indo-Eng. Uses.—In the Philippines, as well as in India, the root of the plant is widely used as a red dye. As a medicine the Tamul physicians use it in decoction to treat diarrhœa and dysentery. The fruit is emmenagogue and perhaps aperient. In Bombay the mashed leaves are applied to wounds and ulcers to hasten cicatrization; they also use the decoction internally as a febrifuge and tonic, 10 grams to 500 of water, a wineglassful twice a day. The root bark contains a crystalline substance called by Anderson morindin, C28H30O15. It is a glucoside and exists in the form of yellow needles, soluble in alcohol and in cold water, insoluble in ether; dissolves in alkalies producing an orange-red color. There is another species, M. tinctoria, Roxb.; M. Royoc, Blanco, called in Tagalog Tumboug̃ aso kapay, the roots of which are used by the Filipinos for the same purposes as the leaves of the former species; the dose, 8 grams a day. The powder is also applied to ulcers and sores, especially those of gangrenous aspect. Botanical Description.—A small tree 11 or more feet high, branches opposite, quadrate at the extremities. Leaves opposite, oval, oblong, smooth, entire, glabrous. Petioles very short, with 2 broad, lanceolate stipules curved outward. Flowers white, opposite the leaves, fixed on globose, solitary receptacles from which spring the flowerets. Calyx proper, very short, monophyllous, a lanceolate leaflet springing from the border. Corolla tubular, woolly inside about the middle, with 5 lobules. Stamens 5, inserted on the walls of the corolla. Anthers thin, incumbent. Pistil somewhat longer than the corolla. Stigma cleft in 2 laminæ. Fruit: the receptacle of the flowerets ripens to a globe bristling with the remains of the calyces, like a berry covered with many smaller ones, each containing 2 monospermous, quadrangular seeds. M. tinctoria, Roxb., is a climbing shrub with leaves opposite, ovate, keeled; petioles very short; flower and fruit like the foregoing species. Habitat.—In Luzon and, especially the M. tinctoria, in Malinta, Calauan and Tanauan. Pæderia fœtida, L. (P. sessiflora, DC.) Nom. Vulg.—Kantutan, Kantutæ, Tag.; Lilitan, Tæ-tæ, Vis. Uses.—The fœtid odor of this plant has suggested both the technical and common names for it. The natives regard it as a cure for rheumatism. The root is emetic. The leaves, boiled and mashed, are applied to the abdomen in retention of urine; the decoction of the leaves is used for the same purpose and also has some reputation as a solvent for vesical calculus. For fever, cloths soaked in the decoction are applied to the head, the same preparation being given internally at the same time. Botanical Description.—A slender, twining plant with leaves 3′ by 1′, opposite, oval, acute, entire, long petioles and caducous stipules. Flowers dark rose color, in compound axillary and terminal cymes. Calyx of 5 persistent lobules. Corolla tubular, pubescent, 5 lobules. Stamens 5, free. Ovary inferior, flattened, 2 uniovulate locules. Style with 2 stigma-bearing branches. Habitat.—Luzon, Mindanao, Cebu, Panay. Compositæ. Eupatorium Ayapana, Vent. Nom. Vulg.—Aya-pana, Sp.; Ayapana, Apana, Tag.; Ayapan, Indo-Eng. Uses.—A native plant of Brazil now naturalized and well known in the Philippines and many other tropical countries; it is called by its Brazilian name, Aya-pana, more or less modified. The entire plant is aromatic and its infusion has an agreeable, bitter taste. Its virtues have been much exaggerated, but it is certainly a good stimulant, diaphoretic and tonic. An infusion, 30 grams of the leaves to 1 liter of water, is given in dyspepsia, a small cup after each meal. In the island of Mauritius this infusion was widely used as a stimulant and aromatic in the cholera epidemics of 1854 and 1856. It is used internally and locally for the bites of venomous snakes and insects. The leaf-juice is a good application for foul ulcers, as is also the decoction of the entire plant. “It appears probable that this plant has fallen into unmerited neglect.”—Pharm. of India. Botanical Description.—An aromatic plant 3° high, leaves opposite, sessile, coherent at the base, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in racemose panicles. Common calyx cylindrical, of many imbricated, awl-shaped scales, the lower ones smaller; within are 20 or more hermaphrodite disk-flowers. Corollas are funnel-form, 5-lobed. Style a little longer than the stamens. Stigmas 2, long. Seed 1, quadrangular, with simple, downy, sessile pappus. Receptacle nude. Habitat.—Common in fields and gardens. Blooms in January. Blumea balsamifera, DC. (Conyza balsamifera, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Sambon, Tag.; Lakbandulan, Hamlibon, Lalakdan, Lakadbulan, Gintingintin, Gabuen, Ayoban, Alibun, Vis.; Sobsob, Iloc. Uses.—Sambon is a panacea among the Filipinos; its virtues are prodigious according to the ignorant natives who wear the leaves in the hat or the “salakod” (rain hat), to prevent “tabardillo” (“burning fever”; tabardillo pintado = spotted fever). They use the decoction to bathe convalescents, and for rheumatism they vaporize it in an improvised bath-cabinet consisting of a chair in which the patient sits enveloped in blankets that reach to the floor and retain the steam. The hot infusion of the leaves is a good diaphoretic taken by the mouth, especially useful in catarrhal bronchitis, and prized as an expectorant by the Chinese and Javanese. Furthermore it is stomachic, antispasmodic and emmenagogue. The camphorous odor of the plant suggested to me its application as an antiseptic lotion for varicose ulcers and my results have been very satisfactory. The infusion for internal use is 30 grams to the liter of water. Botanical Description.—A woody plant 6–9° high. Leaves 1° long, 3′ wide, oblong, lanceolate, acutely serrate, rugose, soft, downy, whitish. Flowers yellow in panicles. Involucre conical, of many linear scales, enclosing 15 or more hermaphrodite disk-flowers and several pistillate ray-flowers. Hermaphrodite: corolla infundibuliform, 5-toothed. Pistillate: corolla very minute, infundibuliform, obscurely 4-toothed. One seed crowned with a simple hairy pappus. Habitat.—Grows universally in the islands and is well known. Blooms in January. Sphœranthus Indicus, L. (S. hirtus, Willd.; S. mollis, Roxb.) Nom. Vulg.—Sambog̃-gala, Tag. Uses.—This plant seems to possess anthelmintic properties and for this purpose it is administered in powder, 2–4 grams with a little molasses or syrup. It is bitter and aromatic and is given in diseases of the stomach and intestines for its tonic and stimulant effect. The odor of the drug is transmitted to both urine and sweat. In India it is used in “bilious diseases” and to dissipate all sorts of tumors. The Hindoos cook it with flour, lard and sugar and eat the mixture as a tonic and to prevent gray hair and baldness. They also give the seed, fried in oil, as an aphrodisiac. The aqueous distillate is a good preparation as it contains the active principle of the plant, a yellow, viscid, essential oil. Botanical Description.—A plant about 1° high, stem and branches bearing 3 serrate wings. Leaves premorse, lanceolate, decurrent, downy. Flowers white, in a globose head, divided into 50 or more groups each with its own calyx of 9 or 10 leaflets surrounding 2 or 3 hermaphrodite, 5-toothed, campanulate flowers. Anthers 5, united. Style 1, thick at extremity. Stigma none. Corolla of pistillate flowers very minute, with 3 obscure teeth. Stigma of 2 down-curved divisions. One seed, 4-angled, imbricated. Habitat.—The rice fields. Blooms in January. Spilanthes Acmella, L. Nom. Vulg.—Hagonog, Tag.; Agonoy, Sp.-Fil., Vis.(?); Palunay, Pam. Uses.—Some native herb-doctors use the root as a purgative, giving a decoction of 4–8 grams to a cup of water. The infusion is used locally for itch and psoriasis. Internally it has a diuretic effect and is reputed to be a solvent of vesical calculi. The leaf juice and the bruised leaves are applied to wounds and atonic ulcers. These leaves with those of “sambon” and “sampaloc” (tamarind) are used to prepare aromatic baths for convalescents, rheumatics and pregnant women. Botanical Description.—A plant with stem drooping, square, grooved, covered with drops of gum resin. Leaves opposite, cordate, oval, lanceolate, serrate, 3 prominent nerves covered with short down. Petioles short, grooved. Flowers yellow, in a sort of umbel, with 3 or more flowerets on long peduncles. Common calyx, 9–11 narrow sepals, concave, fleshy, in 2 rows. Hermaphrodite disk-flowers 40 or more. Corolla tubular, 5-toothed. Anthers longer than corolla. Pistil longer than stamens. Style bifid. Pistillate flowers, 15 or more, forming the rays. Corolla monopetalous, 3-toothed. Style and stigma as in hermaphrodite flowers. Seeds of hermaphrodite flowers quadrangular, crowned by one long awn, and the rudiment of another. Seeds of ray flowers small and sometimes flattened, 2 awns, of which one alone lengthens and becomes conspicuous. Receptacle covered with concave scales. Habitat.—Grows along the shores of the sea and of rivers. It is very well known. Artemisia vulgaris, L. (A. Indica, Willd.) Nom. Vulg.—Ka-María, Santa María, Tinisas, Tag.; Indian Wormwood, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The native women use the infusion of its aromatic leaves to induce menstruation. It is also used as an abortifacient, but is too mild a uterine stimulant to be reliable for that purpose. Its stomachic and tonic properties are common knowledge in the Philippines. The Hindoos use it for those effects and as an antispasmodic in amenorrhœa and hysteria. Dr. Wight states that the leaves and tops are useful in nervous troubles resulting from debility and that a decoction of them makes a good fomentation for phagedenic ulcers. The infusion is prepared in the proportion of 10–30 grams of leaves to 1 liter of water and the powdered leaves are given in doses of 4–8 grams; the aqueous extract 30–40 grams a day. For amenorrhœa the drug is given daily for a week preceding the menstrual date. Botanical Description.—A plant 3° high, stem straight, woody, square toward ends of branches. Leaves alternate, tomentose, decurrent, divided in several places, medium lanceolate. Flowers straw-colored, in axillary and terminal, 1-ranked spikes. Common calyx cylindrical, 2 circles of oval, scarious leaflets around its border, 11 hermaphrodite disk-flowers and about 5 pistillate ray-flowers. Hermaphrodite: Corolla bell-shaped, 5 obtuse teeth; stigmas 2, bent to the sides. Pistillate: Corolla diminutive, 5 toothlets; anther none; stigmas 2. Seeds of both small and quadrate, smaller in the latter. Receptacle nude. Habitat.—Grows throughout the islands and is well known. Carthamus tinctorius, L. Nom. Vulg.—Azafrán de la tierra, Sp.; Biri, Kasubha, Katsumba, Lago, Tag.; Kasabba, Vis.; Kasubha, Kastumba, Pam.; Bastard Saffron, Dyer’s Safflower, Eng. Uses.—This plant must not be confounded with Curcuma longa, L., whose tuber is also frequently called saffron (azafrán), and is used to color food. The flower is the part employed as a condiment coloring the food yellow. Some use them internally in doses of 4 grams to cure icterus. The leaves coagulate milk. The seeds are purgative in dose of 8–16 grams, bruised and taken in emulsion, or 15–30 grams in decoction. The following is the chemical analysis of the plant: Yellow coloring matter, soluble 26.1–36.0 Carthamic acid 0.3– 0.6 Extractive matter 3.6– 6.5 Albumin 1.5– 8.0 Wax 0.6– 1.5 Cellulose, pectin 38.4–56.0 Silica 1.0– 8.4 Oxide of iron, aluminum, oxide of manganese 0.4– 4.6 (Salvetat.) Botanical Description.—A plant 3° high, root gray and spindle-shaped. Stem straight, few branches. Leaves scattered, sessile, partially embracing the stem, lanceolate, serrate with hooked teeth. Flowers yellow, terminal in a sort of corymb. Common calyx semiglobose, with imbricated scales, the border often bearing thorns; numerous hermaphrodite disk flowers, with corolla very long, funnel-form, 5-toothed. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma bifid. Seed large, lacking pappus. Habitat.—Cultivated in the gardens. Plumbagineæ. Leadwort Family. Plumbago Zeylanica, L. (P. viscosa, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Sagdikit, Tag.; Bagbag, Talankaw, Iloc.; White-flowered Leadwort, Eng. Uses.—The root is vesicant and is used by the natives for this purpose. (P. rosea, L., common in India, is more powerful. The Pharmacopœia of India states that both species are worthy of further investigation.) According to the Sanscrit authors it increases the appetite and is useful in dyspepsia, piles, dropsy, diarrhœa and skin diseases. The Filipinos use the infusion locally for itch with good results. A favorite medicine of the Hindoos for flatulence is the old recipe of Susrutas, composed of equal parts of the following substances in powder: Leadwort root, root of Cissampelos Pareira, Picrorrhiza kurroa,1 Aconitum heterophyllum,1 and Terminalia Chebula in dose of 4 grams a day. Dr. Oswald has employed the alcoholic tincture of leadwort in the intermittents, with satisfactory results, and claims that it is a powerful diaphoretic.2 The mashed root is mixed with rice flour and made into a caustic paste to apply to buboes, destroy warts, etc. Women also use the scraped root to induce abortion, introducing it through the vagina into the os uteri. This practice should be strongly condemned on account of its dangerous consequences—metritis, peritonitis and often death. The chemical composition of the root has been studied by Dulong.3 It includes a non-nitrogenous principle, plumbagin, existing in the form of orange-yellow needles, bitter, acrid, volatile, neutral, slightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in ether, alcohol and hot water. The aqueous solution becomes cherry-red on the addition of an alkali, which color is changed to yellow by acids. Basic acetate of lead causes the same color change. Botanical Description.—Plant with stem declined, angular. Leaves lanceolate, entire, rather downy. Petioles at their base embrace the stem. Flowers white, in axillary spikes. Individual involucres, 3 oval leaflets, the lower larger. Calyx long, cleft almost to the base in 5 lineal parts thickly set with small glands, exuding a sticky gum. Corolla salver-shaped, the tube long, square, throat bare, limb divided into 5 obovate parts, ending in stylets. Stamens 5, inserted near the base of the corolla, almost as long as the tube. Style a little shorter than the stamens. Stigma, 5 parts. One long seed enclosed within the calyx, pentangular, covered with a membranaceous skin. Habitat.—In Tanauan (Batangas). Sapotaceæ. Sapodilla Family. Achras Sapota, L. Nom. Vulg.—Chico, Sp.-Fil.; Tsiku, Tag. Uses.—The chico is one of the popular fruits of the Philippines, much appreciated by Europeans as well as the natives. When not entirely ripe it yields a resinous juice that sticks to the lips and affords a disagreeable taste; but when once thoroughly ripe it has a slightly vinous, sweetish taste and is easily digested. Therapeutically its seeds are used as a diuretic, but large doses should be avoided as they contain a small proportion of hydrocyanic acid. The proper dose is 5–6 mashed seeds in sweetened water. They contain, in addition to the above, a fatty substance of the consistency of butter. The trunk bark is tonic and febrifuge; Mr. Bernon4 has isolated from it a crystalline alkaloid, sapotine, soluble in ether, chloroform or alcohol, but not in water; a large per cent. of sapotanic acid and two resins. The trunk exudes, when incised, a milky resin, closely resembling guttapercha and possibly susceptible of the same uses. Botanical Description.—Trees, about 11° high, with leaves lanceolate, keeled, entire, glabrous. Flowers pure white, solitary or by twos, terminal, very long peduncles. Calyx, 6 sepals, 3 within the others, inferior persistent. Corolla jug-shaped, the border divided into 12 parts, the 6 smaller ones alternating and within the others. Stamens 6, inserted near the border of the inner petals and opposite the outer circle. Filaments very short. Style long. Stigma obtuse, fruit globose, resembling a small pear, russet brown, crowned with the hardened style, more than 10 compartments, each containing a seed. Seed oval, flattened, joined to a central fleshy axis. Habitat.—Common all over the Archipelago. Blooms in April. Mimusops Elengi, L. Nom. Vulg.—Kabiki, Tag. Uses.—Its flowers are fragrant and generally well known. The trunk bark is astringent, and in decoction is given by mouth for fevers and diarrhœa. Locally is used as an injection for blenorrhœa, as a gargle for sore throat or relaxed uvula, and a mouth wash to harden the gums. Horsfield states that the Javanese use it as a tonic and antiperiodic. In India an aqueous distillate is employed as a perfume and therapeutically as a stimulant. In Concan they chew the green fruit for toothache and to harden relaxed gums. The decoction of the green fruit serves the same purpose and besides is used to wash wounds and ulcers. Botanical Description.—A large ornamental tree with leaves alternate, oblong, coriaceous, green. Flowers small, straw-colored, star-shaped, very fragrant. Calyx, 8 sepals. Corolla gamopetalous, 16 oblong, lanceolate divisions. Stamens 8, free, short, alternating with 8 petaloid, conical, pubescent staminodia. Ovary free, many ovules. Fruit fleshy, oval, smooth, yellow when ripe, with one or several locules according to the number of matured seeds. Seeds solitary, oblong, flattened. Habitat.—Cultivated in the gardens. Oleaceæ. Olive Family. Jasminum Sambac, Aiton. (Nyctanthes Sambac, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Sampaga, Tag.; Sampaguitas, Sp.-Fil.; Arabian Jasmin, Eng. Uses.—The flower is the most popular and beloved of any in the Philippines (and is commonly referred to as the national flower). In decoction it is used as an eye-wash in catarrhal conjunctivitis. In India the flowers and the leaves have a merited reputation as a lactifuge; 2 handfuls of flowers bruised and applied without moistening, once or twice a day, sometimes checks the secretion of the milk within 24 hours, but generally 2 or 3 days are required for a complete effect. Botanical Description.—Stems scarcely climbing, flattened, pubescent. Leaves opposite, cordate base, lanceolate-ovate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in small, close clusters, white, fragrant. Calyx-teeth 8–9, long and awl-shaped. Corolla, long tube, 7–8 rounded lobes. Stamens 2. Style 1. Stigma cleft in 2 laminæ. Apocynaceæ. Dogbane Family. Allamanda cathartica, L. Nom. Vulg.—Not known. Uses.—As this plant has no common name in the Philippines it is most probable that the natives do not use it. The Portuguese introduced it into India from Brazil. A decoction of the leaves is purgative and is used in lead colic. The milky juice of the plant is emetic and cathartic in large doses, but simply laxative when given in doses of 8 or 10 drops. On account of its possible violent cathartic action great prudence should be exercised in prescribing it. Botanical Description.—A twining shrub with leaves in fours, bright green, oblong, covered with rough hairs. Flowers in compound spikes, yellow. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla 5-lobed, funnel-form. Stamens 5, inserted in throat of corolla, which above them is closed by a crown of hairs. Ovary 1-celled with 2 many-ovuled placentæ. Style cylindrical, terminating in a bilobulate cone. Capsule globular, about the size of a pea, black, coriaceous, thorny, bivalvate. Seeds numerous, each encircled by a broad membranous wing. Habitat.—In Calauang and other parts of Luzon and Panay. Thevetia nerifolia, Suss. (Cerbera Thevetia, L. and Blanco) Nom. Vulg.—Campanelo, Sp.-Fil.; Exile or Yellow Oleander, Eng. Uses.—This shrub is very common in gardens, well known by its pretty yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The trunk bark possesses antiperiodic properties first described by Descourtilz and confirmed later by Dr. G. Bidie and Dr. J. Short. Both the latter used the tincture in 10–15-drop doses 3 times a day. This tincture was prepared by macerating for one week in 150 grams of alcohol 30 grams of fresh bark finely divided. This preparation operates as an emetic and purgative in doses of 30–60 drops. It is evident that the plant possesses very active, even poisonous properties and should be employed with great caution. The decoction of the bark is given as an emetic and cathartic, but very imprudently because there is no means of determining the quantity of active principle, shown by chemical analysis to be a dangerous product. The fruit is very bitter and acrid. The seeds yield by expression 35 to 41% oil (De Vry) and 57% when treated with benzol. It has an agreeable odor resembling that of sweet almonds, its density is 0.9148 at 25° and it is perfectly clear and transparent at that temperature. At 15° it thickens and at 13° solidifies. According to Oudemans it consists of 63% triolein and 37% tripalmin and tristearin; it is not poisonous. After expression De Vry obtained from the caked residue 4% of a crystalline glucoside called by him thevetin. Blas, of the Academy of Medicine of Belgium, studied it later and described it as a white powder of small colorless scales, odorless, very bitter, soluble at 14° in 122 parts of water, in alcohol, in crystallizable acetic acid, insoluble in ether; formula C54H34O24. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it, producing a dark red color that changes to cherry red and then after several hours to violet. The color disappears if water be added. Boiled in acid solution the glucoside changes to a new substance, theveresin (C48H70O17), white, amorphous, slightly soluble in boiling water and in alcohol, insoluble in benzine or chloroform, soluble in alkalies, very bitter. Both substances are energetic narcotic poisons; but the plant contains another even more powerful poison isolated by Warden, of Calcutta; it does not form crystals, it is very bitter, freely soluble in water, and is turned yellow by sulphuric and nitric acids. Thevetin and theveresin exercise a marked toxic effect on the heart. The former induces emetic and cathartic phenomena, trembling and progressive weakness. The latter does not cause vomiting or diarrhœa, but anæsthesia and rigidity of the limbs. Both poisons arrest the heart in systole. Injected hypodermically they are irritant, are eliminated by the liver, but are not found in the urine. Botanical Description.—A shrub, about 10° high, with leaves nearly sessile, somewhat bunched at the ends of the branches and overlapping, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers about 2′ long. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla straw-colored, cylindrical, very narrow below, but the limb very large, spreading into 5 lobes with greenish, superimposed borders. Stamens 5, inserted in the throat, anthers lanceolate. Ovaries 2, united at base, free above, unilocular. Style simple, enlarging at the base in a bilobed stigma. Fruit a fleshy drupe resembling somewhat a small apple, the pit very hard, semilunar, flattened, with 4 compartments and as many solitary seeds. Habitat.—Common in all gardens and on the seashore. Cerbera Odallam, Gaertn. (C. manghas, Bl. & Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Toktok-kaló, Tag. Uses.—The milky juice of the plant is emetic and purgative. The chemist De Vry has isolated from it a poisonous alkaloid analogous to “thevetin,” which has just been considered. The seeds are likewise emetic and toxic. The Javanese call the fruit “bimaro” and affirm that it possesses the same properties as “datura.” The bruised leaves are used locally for hepatic eruptions; the bark is used for the same purpose and is purgative. The use of the plant is dangerous and is condemned by the Pharmacopœia of India. Botanical Description.—A small shrub with forked branches. Leaves (overlapping) at ends of branches, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in umbellate spikes. Calyx, 5 caducous lobules. Corolla white, twisted, cylindrical, with salver-shaped limb divided in 5 rhomboid lobes, throat stellate and woolly. Stamens 5. Filaments joined to the corolla, their ends thickened. Anthers arrow-shaped. Ovary, 2 uniovulate locules. Style, same length as stamens. Stigma thick, conical, lobulate. Two drupes joined at the base (one usually aborted), brown, large, oval, fleshy, with woody fibrous nut of a single flattened seed. Habitat.—Luzon. Blooms in July. Plumeria acutifolia, Poir. (P. alba, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Calachuche, Sp.-Fil.; Kalatsutsi, Kalasusi, Tag. Uses.—This tree, beloved for its fragrant flowers, has a wide therapeutic use in India and the Philippines. The bark is a bitter hydragogue cathartic and is given in decoction (5–10 grams to 200 water) principally for dropsy; however the milky juice of the trunk is preferable for this purpose, given in emulsion in doses of 0.50–0.80 grams. The bark and the tips of the branches are given as an emmenagogue. The bark of the root and of the trunk is an excellent remedy for blenorrhagia. The fresh bark is thoroughly comminuted and mixed with sweetened water in the proportion of 60 grams to 4 liters; this mixture is put in the sun for 4 days, and shaken from time to time. It is then strained and given in doses of 4–5 glassfuls a day, at the same time with refreshing and emollient drinks, and prolonged tepid baths. At first this preparation exerts a purgative action, but later acts upon the urinary organs, rapidly lessening the suppurative process in urethritis. The bark may also be associated with wine or beer, in the proportion of 30 grains to the liter, the dose being 2–4 small cupfuls a day and Dr. Grosourdy employs the extract of the bark in doses aggregating 0.20–0.25 gram a day, gradually increased till at the end of a week 6 grams are taken daily (Dr. J. Amadeo). The bruised leaves are applied locally to contusions to reduce the swelling. The juice is used externally as a rubefacient in rheumatic affections of the joints. In Concan they use a decoction of the root for diarrhœa. The flower buds are chewed with buyo, for intermittent fever and the juice is applied locally for itch. Peckolt and Geuther isolated from the bark the glucoside, agoniadin (C10H14O6), which crystallizes in silky crystals fusible at 155°, slightly soluble in water, alcohol, bisulphuret of carbon, ether and benzine; soluble in nitric or sulphuric acids. In solution it is a golden yellow soon changing to green. Boiled in a dilute acid it splits into glucose and an undetermined substance. Oudeman obtained plumieric acid (C10H10O5) from the milky juice deprived of its resin; the acid exists as microscopic, needle-like crystals, soluble in boiling water, alcohol and ether. It melts and decomposes at 130°. Botanical Description.—A tree, 12–18° high, commonly cultivated for ornament, well known in the islands, almost constantly bearing fragrant flowers, but rarely bearing fruit. Branches forked and peculiarly stumpy at the ends. Leaves alternate, broad lanceolate, entire, glabrous, the apices curved downward. Petioles short. Flowers creamy white, light yellow in the throat. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla twisted, funnel-form, 5-lobed. Stamens 5, hidden in depths of the tube. Anthers dart- or arrow-formed. Style very short, thickened above. Stigma 2-parted. Two horizontal, cylindrical and long follicles joined at their bases, with numerous seeds in hollow receptacles, each seed encircled by a wing. Alstonia scholaris, Br. (Echites scholaris, L. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Dita, Tag.; Dallopawen, Iloc.; Dita or Alstonia Tree, Eng. Uses.—The trunk bark is a febrifuge of great importance; it is official in the Pharmacopœia of India and is widely used in the Philippines. Personally I have had occasion to use it in several cases of malarial fever in the town of San Mateo near Manila. It is astringent, anthelmintic and antiperiodic, highly useful in chronic diarrhœa and dysentery, not only for its astringent effects but for its tonic and restorative action. As a tonic it gives as good results as quinine. The dry powdered bark is given internally in wafers of 20–30 centigrams. The infusion is prepared from 15 grams of the dry comminuted bark to 300 of water. The dose is 30–60 grams 2 or 3 times a day. Another convenient preparation is the tincture, 75 grams of the powdered bark macerated 7 days in 500 grams of alcohol, shaking from time to time. It is then filtered and enough alcohol added to make up the 500 cc. The dose is 4–8 grams a day. I have often used the following wine as a tonic for convalescents and patients suffering from general debility: Finely powdered bark, 25 grams, muscatel or dry sherry one bottle; macerate a week, shaking every day, and filter; dose ½ wineglass with equal parts water a few minutes before each meal; children or very weak patients should take it after eating; it should always be diluted. G. Grupe, a Manila pharmacist, treating the bark in 1883 by the same process as that used in the preparation of quinine, obtained a bitter substance which he named Ditaine. According to Grupe Dr. Pina used this substance with great success in the treatment of malarial fevers, but neither Grupe’s report nor Pina’s experiment are of any scientific value, inasmuch as they have neglected to mention the doses in which the so-called alkaloid was employed. Later analyses by Hesse and Jobst revealed several principles: two alkaloids ditamine (C16H19NO2), soluble in ether; Ditaine or Echitamine (C22H28NO4 + H2O) insoluble in ether, soluble in water; acetic acid and two amorphous substances dextrogyrous in ethereal solution, one of them a resin, Echicauchina (C25H40O2), the other neutral, Echiretin (C35H56O2); two crystallizable principles, dextrogyrous: Echicerin (C30H48O2), Echitein (C42H70O2) and Echitin (C32H52O2). Ditaine is employed under the same circumstances and in the same dose as quinine. (The Hindoo writer, K. L. Dey, states that the plant yields an inferior quality of gutta-percha.) Botanical Description.—A tree, 50 or more feet high, the trunk covered with small eminences resembling the scars of thorns. Branches radiating. Leaves radiating, 5, 6 or more, somewhat elliptical in form, pointed at the apex. Petioles very short, with a pointed glandule on the inner surface of the base. Flowers white, terminal, in umbellate racemes. Calyx very short, 5-toothed. Corolla twisted, tubular, the limb 5-lobuled; throat open, encircled with down. Stamens 5, hidden within the throat and inserted on the tube. Filaments almost wanting. Anthers arrow-shaped. Style as long as the stamens, somewhat flattened, a scarcely visible line throughout its length. Stigma bifid, placed above a cylindrical zone, two follicles, 1° long and 1″ thick, twisted like a string, containing the seeds in a row. Seeds cylindrical with a hairy awn at both ends. Habitat.—In the forests of Luzon, especially in Batangas. Blooms in April. Nerium odorum, Aiton. (N. oleander, L. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Adelfa, Sp.; Baladri, Tag.; Sweet-scented Oleander, Eng. Uses.—In the Philippines and in Spain this plant is well known to be poisonous. The bark and the leaves of both the red-flowered and white-flowered varieties are boiled in cocoanut oil and the product is used for inunction in itch and other skin diseases. The bruised root is a useful application for chancroids. We have stated that the plant is poisonous, and indeed it is actively so in the tropics. It is now recognized as an energetic cardiac poison, comparable with strophanthus, destined to play an important part in therapeutics. Dr. Pouloux has made a study of the hydro-alcoholic extract of oleander and reports that it exerts a marked effect on the heart of frogs and rabbits, arresting them in systole. Where there is asystolia, such as we encounter in Bright’s disease, without compensation, it stimulates the heart and increases the urine in the same manner as digitalis. No contraindications to its use are as yet known. It occasions no disagreeable symptoms and may be used many days consecutively provided that the daily dose does not exceed 10–15 centigrams. The poisonous properties of the plant reside in two alkaloids isolated by Lukowsky from the leaves: oleandrine, extremely toxic and pseudo-curarine, as its name indicates, resembling curare in its action. Oleandrin is yellow, semicrystalline, soluble in water, alcohol, ether, chloroform and olive oil; fusible at 70–75° and changing to a greenish oil. With HCl it forms a crystalline salt. It is a violent irritant of the mucous membranes and given internally it causes emesis, diarrhœa, tetanic convulsions and death. It arrests the cardiac movements in doses of 25 milligrams. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps experimented with the drug on his own person, using a solution of 30 grams of the extract in 120 grams of wine. He began by taking three drops of this preparation four times a day, adding a drop to each dose every day, so that at the end of 12 days he was taking 48 drops between 6 a. m. and 9 p. m. He reached a maximum of 64 drops a day but was forced to abandon his experiment at that point on account of the unpleasant symptoms induced—loss of appetite, great weakness and muscular pains. His deduction was that the plant contained a “destructive and irritant principle.” The experiment is of interest as demonstrating the maximum dose of the drug. The active principles of the plant reside principally in the leaves and bark, but that they are abundantly present in other parts is proved by the death of several soldiers in Corsica from having eaten meat roasted on a spit of oleander wood. Botanical Description.—A small tree, about 6° high. Leaves coriaceous, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in terminal cymes, rose-color or white, single or double. Calyx 5-parted. Corolla 15 petals, the inner ones larger, disposed in 3 groups of 5. Stamens 10, fixed on receptacle; filaments short. Style shorter than stamens. Two follicles, sharp-pointed, channeled, containing many imbricated seeds each with an awn. Asclepiadaceæ. Milkweed Family. Calotrops gigantea, R. Br. (Asclepias gigantea, Willd. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kapal-kapal, Tag.; Swallow-Wort, Eng.; Mudar, Indo-Eng. Uses.—This plant is official in the Pharmacopœia of India as an alterative, tonic, diaphoretic and emetic. J. J. Durant, having observed that the natives used it for dysentery, experimented with it quite successfully in that disease. For adults he gradually raised the dose from 1.10 to 4 grams, preferring smaller doses, however, for mild cases. To children he prescribed 5–10 centigrams for each year of age, 3 or 4 times a day. He remarked that the effects produced were identical with those of ipecac administered in Brazilian fashion. The part of the plant used is the dry root powdered. The usual dose is 15–50 centigrams 3 times a day, gradually increased; as an emetic 2–4 grams. The milky juice that escapes from the stem on the slightest abrasion is a drastic purgative, given commonly in dropsy, lumbricoids, etc. Pledgets of cotton impregnated with the juice and packed in the cavities of carious teeth, relieve toothache. It is applied locally for various skin diseases, including syphilitic ulcers, and as a depilatory. Some races of India, such as the Rajputs of the districts of Allahab and of Khangor, use this milk-juice to poison their female infants whom they are accustomed to regard as a vexatious burden. Therapeutically they use it with honey, locally for sore throat. The dry and powdered juice has been used in small doses as an alterative in the treatment of tuberculous leprosy, but it has not given results any better than many other drugs. In syphilis and mercurial cachexia its results are less doubtful. In 1881 Dr. Riddell obtained a sort of gutta-percha from the juice, previously observed by Professor Redwood. Mooden Sheriff states that the most active parts of the plant are the root bark and the dried juice. He adds that the action of the juice is irregular and even dangerous, and that the bark is active in direct proportion to its age. He recommends that the inert tuberous layer of the bark be removed; prepared thus and powdered it is emetic in doses of 2.50–3 grams. Duncan claims to have isolated from the bark an active principle which he called mudarin from “mudar,” the Indian name of the plant. Following the same process Flückiger was unable to obtain the substance, but did isolate 1½% of an acrid resin, soluble in ether and in alcohol; a mucilage and a bitter principle decolorized by chloroform and ether. It is probable that this is the active principle of the “Calotropis gigantea.” Warden and Waddell in 1881 isolated a substance crystallizable in nodular masses, with the formula C17H28O, analogous to the albana of gutta-percha. Botanical Description.—A small tree, 7–8° high, with straight stem, branched and woody. Leaves sessile, opposite, cleft at the base, oval, fleshy and woolly. Flowers lateral in simple umbels of 3 or more flowerets. Calyx 5-cleft. Corolla monopetalous, 5 acute lobes, white, of rare and beautiful form. Nectaries 5, united throughout their length with the receptacle, their bases curved like the sides of the fleur de lis. Above the nectaries is a 5-angled crown, the extremity of the receptacle; in each angle a black anther. Two large follicles narrowed at the ends, woolly, the apex somewhat curved to one side, containing many imbricated seeds, each with a tuft of long hairs. Habitat.—Bauang, Taal and the volcanic island of Taal. Blossoms in April. Tylophora asthmatica, Wight. (Asclepias asthmatica, Roxb.) Nom. Vulg.—(?) Uses.—We are ignorant of the uses the Filipinos make of this plant. It is official in the Pharmacopœia of India, the dry powdered leaf being the part employed, and its emetic, diaphoretic and expectorant properties are well known in that country. Roxburgh has used the root as an emetic and Anderson has employed it in the same manner as ipecac in dysentery. Later the experience of Anderson was confirmed by O’Shaughnessy; though in place of the root he used the leaf, the properties of which he regards as more certain and uniform. Dr. J. Kirkpatrick has noted that the juice of the root and its powder are used by the natives of Mysore as an emetic, and adds that he himself has used it for that purpose in a thousand cases with good results. In its effect on dysentery as well as in its emetic effect it resembles ipecacuanha. He used the powder in doses of 1.20–1.80 gr., to which he added 3–6 centigrams of tartar emetic when he desired to obtain an energetic emetic action. Like O’Shaughnessy he prefers the powdered leaves. He considers it a good substitute for ipecac, not only as an emetic, but as a remedy in asthma, dysentery and catarrhal affections; Drs. Oswald and Mooden Sheriff have made the same observations. The latter advises the administration of the juice of the plant for snake bites till vomiting is produced; then follow with diffusible stimulants. The emetic dose of the powdered leaves is 1.20–1.80 grams, the expectorant and diaphoretic dose 10–30 centigrams. The concentrated infusion of the leaves has an acrid taste. Tannic acid, the neutral acetate of lead and caustic potash produce with it an abundant precipitate; the perchloride of iron colors it a dark green. Broughton, of Ootaemund (India), informed Hanbury and Flückiger, from whom we quote, that in 1872 he obtained a very small quantity of crystals from a large quantity of leaves. He had not enough to make an analysis, but injected a solution of the crystals into a dog with resulting vomiting and diarrhœa. Botanical Description.—A vigorous plant with scandent stem 2–4 meters long, the more recent growth woolly. Leaves opposite, entire, 5–12 centimeters long and 2–6 broad, oval or rounded. Petiole striated and short. Flowers in umbelliferous cymes, compound, axillary, solitary and alternate, with woolly peduncles; hermaphrodite, regular, small, of a pale green color inside and a light purple outside. Calyx gamosepalous, with 5 lobules. Corolla gamopetalous, 5 oval, twisted lobules. Staminal crown composed of 5 fleshy scales, joined to the staminal tube. Stamens 5, inserted on the throat of the corolla, filaments joined to form a very short tube with anthers straight, short and crowned by a membranous bilocular appendix. The gynœcium consists of 2 unilocular ovaries each containing an indefinite number of ovules. Style with a pentagonal stigma which bears in each angle a glandular body. Fruits compound with two separate follicles, large, lanceolate, smooth, 8–10 centimeters long and 5 in circumference. Each encloses a seed, hairy, albuminous with straight embryo and flattened cotyledons. Habitat.—Mountains of San Mateo. Loganiaceæ. Logania Family. Strychnos Ignatii, Berg. (S. Philippensis, Blanco; Ignatia amara, L.; Ignatia Philippinea, Lour.) Nom. Vulg.—Pepita Fruta, Sp.-Fil.; Pepita sa katbalog̃an, Kabalog̃an, Tag., Pam.; Pangaguason, Aguason, Kanlara, Mananaog, Dankagi, Katalog̃a, Igasud, Vis.; St. Ignatius Bean, Eng. Uses.—The part of the plant employed is the seed, known in addition to the above common names as Pepita de San Ignacio and Pepita de Cabalonga (for katbolog̃an). The natives handle it with the greatest imprudence, selling everywhere in the markets and in the Chinese shops, called tindag̃-bayag̃. It is not only a remedy among them, but a sort of panacea, to which they attribute, among other virtues, that of expelling evil spirits, simply worn about the neck. They grate it with a piece of earthen pot, mix with a little “tuba” vinegar and apply it to the temples for headache. In bites of poisonous animals they advise the application of the powdered seed over the wound, a treatment which instead of being beneficent might easily be harmful to the patient. Before proceeding further, let us give the chemical composition of the seeds in order that their uses may be the better understood. Strychnine is found in them in the proportion of ½–1½ and brucine ½%–1.4%. Flückiger and Hanbury by drying it over sulphuric acid and burning it with “cal sòdica” obtained 1.78% of nitrogen which represents 10% of albuminoid material. Strychnine and brucine exist in combination with igasuric acid discovered by Ludwig in 1873. The proportion of both the alkaloids is greater than in the seeds of nux vomica which contain only .25–.50% strychnine and .12–.05% brucin, although some authors give it as high as 1.01%. Strychnine can be obtained more readily and in larger proportions from St. Ignatius bean, but it is generally obtained from nux vomica seeds on account of the cheapness of the latter. It is more energetic than nux vomica and its use in medicine should be condemned, preference, however, being given to the official preparations among which the best known is that commonly called “Bitter Drops of Beaumé,” of which the following is the composition: Grated St. Ignatius’ beans 500 grams. Potassium carbonate 5 grams. Soot (?) 1 gram. 60% alcohol 1,000 grams. Macerate for 10 days, strain, express and filter. Dose, 1–16 drops in a little water or wine before each meal, for dyspepsia, anæmia, convalescence from fevers, and other conditions in which a tonic is indicated. The indications for the use of this drug are the same as those for nux vomica, keeping in mind the difference in dose. Botanical Description.—This plant grows in the deep forests of Samar and Masbate. That industrious and distinguished botanist, D. Regino García, found it growing abundantly in Paranas, Island of Samar. It is a robust vine, the trunk sometimes as thick as a man’s thigh, climbing to the tops of the highest trees, apparently without preference as to its host, inasmuch as he saw it growing indifferently on Ficus, Dipterocarpus, Litsaca, etc. The seed which most interests us and is very common, is about the size of an olive, round and convex on one side, angulose and flattened on the other by being compressed with many others within the fruit which contains 50 of them. Its surface is blackish with a gray-blue tinge. It is hard and corneous. Its taste is extremely bitter. Branches opposite, smooth, the ends square. Leaves opposite, oval, much pointed at the apex, entire, glabrous, with 3 prominent nerves. Petioles very short. Flowers in panicles of many flowerets. Calyx inferior, 5-cleft, very short. Corolla 6–7 times longer than the calyx, funnel-form, 5-lobed. Anthers 5, sessile, fixed in the throat of the corolla. Ovary very small. Style filiform, same length as the stamens. Stigma truncate and thick. Drupe globose, often oval, large, smooth, with thick, woody shell of a single compartment containing seeds as described above. Boraginaceæ. Borage Family. Ehretia buxifolia, Roxb. (Carmonea heterophylla, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Mag̃it, Alag̃itg̃it, Tag., Vis. Uses.—The leaves dried in the shade are used in some Visayan towns, in infusion to take the place of tea. The root is used by the Hindoo physicians as an alterative. Dr. R. Ross has employed it for that purpose in a decoction of 60 grams to 500 cc. of water; 60 cc. a day of this preparation gave him good results in secondary and constitutional syphilis. The Mohammedans of India consider the root an antidote for vegetable poisons. Botanical Description.—Small tree, 5–6° high, trunk straight. Leaves alternate or bunched in 3′s or 4′s at the nodes, lanceolate or spatulate, 3-toothed at apex, sometimes serrate toward the apex, set with short, stiff hairs. Petioles very short. Flowers axillary, in racemose panicles of a few flowers each. Common peduncle long, pedicel short. Calyx free, bell-shaped, persistent, divided almost to base into 5 narrow, downy parts. Corolla bell-shaped, 5 oval lobules. Stamens 5. Ovary oval, within the flower. Style bifid. Stigmas simple, truncate. Drupe globose, with hard, slightly furrowed putamen of 6 locules and solitary seeds. Habitat.—Malinta and many other parts of the Visayas. Blooms in January. Convolvulaceæ. Convolvulus Family. Ipomœa hederacea, Jacq. (I. nil, Roth.; Convolvulus nil, L. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Bulakan, Tag.; Kala-Danah, Indo-Eng. Uses.—This plant is not used as a medicine by the Filipinos, but is official in the Pharmacopœia of India from which we copy its indications and official preparations. The seed is the part employed, its cathartic properties being much like those of jalap, though less energetic. An excellent substitute for the latter is 2 or 3 grams of kala-danah seeds in powder form, and no unpleasant effects attend its operation. The official preparations are: Extract of Kaladana.—Dose, 30–60 centigrams in pill. Powdered seeds 500 grams. Alcohol 2 liters. Water 4½ liters. Tincture of Kaladana.—Dose, 8–12 grams. Seeds 75 grams. Alcohol 500 grams. Compound Powder of Kaladana.—Dose, 3–3½ grams. Powdered seeds 150 grams. Acid tartrate of potassium 270 grams. Powdered ginger 30 grams. The last is an excellent substitute for the corresponding preparation of jalap. Resin of Kaladana.—Dose, 30–50 centigrams. It is prepared like resin of jalap and is a safe and sure purgative. In mass it has a dark color, but is gray when powdered. The odor is rather unpleasant, the taste sweetish and then acrid, nauseous, persistent, exciting the saliva and irritating the fauces. It was introduced into practice by Dr. G. Vidie. Botanical Description.—A twiner with round, downy stem. Leaves heart-shaped, 3-lobed, the middle one broad-lanceolate, the lateral ones rather rectangular with petioles of equal length with the leaves. Flowers large, rose color or pale blue, in axillary cymes of 2 or 3 flowers each. Calyx, 5 long, downy parts. Corolla bell-shaped, 5 faint lobes. Stamens 5, free, inserted in the corolla. Ovary free, 3 biovulate locules. Style simple. Stigma trilobed. Seed vessels globose with 3 locules each containing 2 seeds. Seeds convex on dorsum, 1/2 cm. broad by 1 cm. long, testa black. Habitat.—Manila. Blooms in August. Ipomœa pes-capræ, Roth. (Convolvulus pes-capræ L. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Katagkatag, Lagayray, Lampayog, Bagasoa, Kamigag, Daripay, Tagaray, Arodayday, Lambayog, Tag., Vis.; Lambayog, Iloc. Uses.—The dry, powdered leaves are dusted over bruises and ulcers. The entire plant is very mucilaginous and the bruised fresh leaves are applied like poultices to cancers and ulcerating tumors. In India the boiled leaves are applied locally in colic and in rheumatism; the juice is given internally in dropsy as a diuretic, the pounded leaves at the same time serving as a poultice to the œdematous parts. Botanical Description.—A plant that creeps extensively, the stem taking root. Leaves with 2 well-marked lobules. Flowers rose-lilac color, in axillary panicles with long pedicels. Corolla very large, bell-shaped, the limb 5-angled and 5-nerved. Stamens 5, unequal in height. Stigma globose, marked by a line; later it divides in two. Seed vessel ovate, 2-celled, in each cell 2 downy seeds convex on one side, angular on the other. Habitat.—Very common on the seashore. Blooms in January. Ipomœa Turpethum, R. Br. (Convolvulus Turpethum, L.; C. maximus, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Albohol, Sp.; Turpeth Root, Indian Jalap, Eng. Uses.—The root, known in the Philippines as “turbita,” is a purgative and is a component part of the tincture of jalap, one of the most positive and active of known cathartics. But turpeth root is seldom used alone, for its action is so uncertain that Sir W. O’Shaughnessy pronounced the plant unworthy of a place in the Pharmacopœia of India. The dose of the powder is 1–4 grams, the resin 40–50 cgms., the decoction of the root 4–12 grams. The active principle is a resin soluble in ether and a glucoside, turpethin, C34H56O16. In the east of India they make offerings of the flowers to the god Shiva, and also put them to more practical use by applying them to the head for neuralgic headache. Botanical Description.—A vine with quadrangular stem. Leaves heart-shaped. Flowers axillary, numerous, in umbels. Calyx deeply cleft in 5 imbricated, ovate, fleshy parts. Corolla bell-shaped, folded. Stamens 5, unequal in height. Ovary inserted on an hypogynous disk, with 2 biovulate compartments. Style same length as stamens. Stigma bilobulate, globose. Seed vessel square, encircled by calyx, 2 locules each with 2 seeds. Habitat.—Common in Bauang and Pasig. Blooms in November. Solanaceæ. Nightshade Family. Solanum nigrum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Hierba mora, Sp.; Konty, Onty, Gamagamatisan, Tag.; Lagpakon, Bolagtob, Lubilubi, Vis.; Kuty, Lubilubi, Bic.; Black or Common Nightshade, Eng. Uses.—In the Philippines the entire plant is boiled and used for food, with the precaution of pouring off the first 2 or 3 waters in which it is cooked, which contain an active principle capable of causing such disagreeable symptoms as vertigo and nausea. A decoction of the leaves serves to cleanse chronic sores and in fact improves their condition; it is also used as a lotion for various forms of dermatitis, for erysipelas and old burns. The plant is narcotic, antispasmodic and like belladonna it dilates the pupil. In India the decoction is given internally, 200–250 grams, for hypertrophy of the liver, and it is considered a good diuretic and alterative. For such uses they heat the above dose in a clay vessel till the color changes from green to brown, when it is cooled and given next day. Its action is diuretic and hydragogue-cathartic. Mooden Sheriff recommends this treatment highly, and for dropsy further advises the aqueous extract, 12 grams during the day divided into 3 or 4 doses. Small doses of 30–60 grams of the decoction prepared as above described, are of use in some chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis. In 1821 Defosses, of Besançon, obtained solanine from the fruit, previously isolated from the S. Dulcamara. Botanical Description.—A plant about 2° high, stem straight, 3–4-angled, with white dots. Leaves lanceolate. Flowers white, in 2-ranked racemes. Calyx inferior, 5 persistent teeth. Corolla, 5 petals somewhat down-curved. Berry small, black when ripe. Habitat.—Universally common. Blooms in January. Capsicum fastigiatum, Bl. (C. minimum, Roxb.) Nom. Vulg.—Chili picante, Sp.-Fil.; Sili, Tag.; Capsicum, Red Pepper, etc., Eng. Uses.—The fruit of this species of pepper plant is called agí in Cuba and Porto Rico; it is in common use as a condiment in the Philippines. As a tonic and stimulant it is a useful article of food in hot countries where the digestive functions become sluggish. Used in moderation it prevents dyspepsia and consequent diarrhœa. It is used as a gargle for hoarseness, decreasing the congestion of the larynx and vocal cords. Gargle.— Tincture of capsicum 8 grams. Water 160 grams. Mix. Recently capsicum in powder, extract, or tincture, has been recommended internally in the treatment of incipient hemorrhoids. The dose is .50 to 3 grams of the powder in pills or capsules; watery extract, 0.30–0.60; tincture, 10–30 drops. The C. annuum, L., and other varieties of red pepper serve the same uses as the above. Botanical Description.—Stem 4-angled. Leaves opposite, ovate-lanceolate, entire. Petioles short. Flowers greenish-white in little clusters, drooping. Corolla wheel-shaped. Fruit straight, conical, slender, scarcely 1′ long. Habitat.—Universally common in the islands. Blooms at all times. Datura alba, Nees. (D. Metel, Roxb. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Talamponay, Tag., Pam.; Takbibug̃, Vis.; Dhatura, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The applications of this species are identical with those of D. Stramonium and it is official in the Pharmacopœia of India. It is antispasmodic, narcotic and toxic, and is used quite commonly with criminal intent in India and Indo-China. The cooked and bruised leaves make an efficient poultice in articular rheumatism. The symptoms of poisoning by “dhatura” are: dilatation of the pupil, general malaise, dryness of the fauces and skin, hallucinations, rapid pulse, coma and death or permanent mania. The dry leaf is smoked to abort asthma, and though its action is uncertain, it is one of the many remedies that should be tried, which though ineffective in one case may in another afford positive relief in this distressing disease. Not more than 1.50 grams should be smoked in one day and their use should be discontinued if any symptom of intoxication supervenes. The Pharmacopœia of India contains a tincture made from 75 grams of the ground seeds and 500 grams of alcohol. Dr. Waring states that 20 drops of this tincture are equivalent to 6 centigrams of opium and that in some cases it has given him better narcotic results than the opium. The extract is made from 500 grams of the powdered seeds, 500 cc. ether, 500 cc. alcohol and 500 cc. water. Dose, 5–20 centigrams a day in 4 doses. The D. fastuosa, L., known in Manila by the common name of Talamponay na itim, Tag., possesses the same properties as the above. The Filipino physician, Sr. Zamora, successfully employed a poultice of bruised leaves cooked in vinegar and applied to the forehead and backs of the hands to reduce the fever of tuberculous patients. Neither the leaves nor seeds of these two varieties of Datura have been studied from a chemical standpoint, but there is little doubt that the active principle is the daturine (atropine and hyoscyamine) that exists so abundantly in D. Stramonium. Botanical Description.—Plant 5–6° high, with nodose branches, forked. Leaves ovate, angled, somewhat downy. Flowers large, white, axillary, solitary. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed. Corolla funnel-shaped, the limb 5-angled and 5-folded. Stamens 5, same length as calyx. Anthers long, flattened. Stigma thick, oblong, divisible in 2 leaves. Seed vessel globose, thorny, 4-valved over the base of the calyx. Seeds numerous, flattened, kidney-shaped. (Resembles closely the common Jamestown Weed of America, though much taller with much larger flowers.) Habitat.—Common on the shores of the sea. The D. fastuosa is differentiated by its violet flowers and double corolla. Nicotiana Tabacum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Tabaco, Sp.; Tobacco, Eng. Uses.—Tobacco is a powerful sedative and antispasmodic, but owing to the accidents it may give rise to, its use in therapeutics is very limited. Like all the active Solanaceæ it is effective against neuralgia and spasm of the muscular tissues and is therefore indicated in strangulated hernia and in intestinal obstruction. In these conditions the infusion of 1–5 grams of the dried leaf to 250 grams of water is given by enema. Trousseau advises non-smokers who suffer from chronic constipation to smoke a cigarette fasting, a practice which, according to him, stimulates defecation. For the same condition the people of southern India are accustomed to apply a poultice of the bruised leaves to the anal region. Tobacco has been used by enema to combat tetanus; Dr. Lesth, of the General Hospital for Europeans, Bombay, claims to have obtained excellent results by applying a poultice over the entire length of the spinal column. Dr. Dymock has confirmed this practice. A decoction of the leaves is used as a lotion to destroy “pediculi capitis and pubis,” and to wash gangrenous ulcers. The daily increasing practice of smoking, like all other subjects, divides mankind into two camps, one for and one against the habit. Both parties exaggerate their arguments. The abuse of the plant without doubt sets up disturbances of the digestion, the heart and the nervous system. It is furthermore positive that persons of a certain disposition and with certain ailments are injured by even a moderate use of tobacco. The above facts serve as arms for the opponents of the habit; the robust who smoke and drink to excess and meet with an accidental death on a railroad or from an acute disease that overtakes them in the midst of perfect health, serve as arguments for the defenders, to prove the innocence of the custom. The antiseptic qualities of the smoke and of the entire plant also lend the smoker a defensive argument, as he may uphold the habit as hygienic and highly useful in preventing microbic infection. The antiseptic power of tobacco smoke is undoubted, but it is intolerable that a physician under the pretext of avoiding self infection should enter the house of his patient and continue smoking at the bedside. Chronic nicotine poisoning is the result of a gradual intoxication by the absorption of the active principle of tobacco, the alkaloid nicotine. Excessive smoking conduces to nicotism, more common in Europe than in the tropics, because the natives of Europe smoke the pipe and being confined in closed dwellings, breathe continuously an atmosphere of smoke; in the Philippines, on the contrary, the pipe is almost unknown and owing to the nature of the dwellings the smoking is carried on practically in the open air. An injurious practice of the Filipino smokers is that of “swallowing the smoke,” and this is a fitting point to call attention to an error of Dujardin-Beaumetz, who states that “in those who habitually swallow the smoke the nicotine acts directly upon the stomach.” The expression “swallow smoke” (tragar el humo) does not mean to force it into the stomach by an act of deglutition, and I am sure no one attempts to dispose of it in that way; but to inspire or breath it into the air passages. It is evident that this latter habit does not involve the stomach, but those who practice it expose themselves more to nicotism than those who keep the smoke in the mouth or expel it through the nose. The first cigar causes symptoms familiar to nearly everybody; dizziness, malaise, cold sweat, vomiting, diarrhœa, dilatation of the pupils and rapid heart action—an acute intoxication. Chronic intoxication or nicotism manifests itself by disturbances of digestion, vision and especially circulation. It has been assigned as one of the causes of early atheroma and of angina pectoris. It should therefore be proscribed in persons who present symptoms of gastro-intestinal or of heart disease, and in every patient who complains of slight precordial pains, commonly attributed to flatus, but in reality cardiac neuralgia, a fugitive symptom announcing the possibility of that grave accident, angina pectoris, capable of ending the life of the patient with one stroke. Nicotine (C10H14N2) is an oleaginous liquid heavier than water, colorless, changing to dark yellow on contact with the air. Nicotianin or “camphor of tobacco” is another substance found in the leaves, crystalline, tasteless, with an odor resembling tobacco. Nicotinic acid is a product of the combustion of nicotine. Botanical Description.—The tobacco plant is so familiar to all Americans that its description here would be superfluous. It grows in all parts of the islands, the best qualities being cultivated in the northern provinces of Luzon, especially Cagayan and La Isabela. Scrophulariaceæ. Figwort Family. Limnophila menthastrum, Benth. (Tala odorata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Tala, Taramhampam, Tag.; Talatala, Pam.; Taratara, Iloc. Uses.—An infusion of the leaves is given as a diuretic and digestive tonic. The plant is aromatic. It is seldom used, but is given for the same troubles and in the same doses as chamomile and Eupatorium Ayapana. Botanical Description.—A plant 1° high, with leaves opposite, lanceolate, ovate, serrate, hairy, many small pits on the lower face. Flowers rose color, solitary, sessile. Calyx, 5 sharp teeth. Corolla tubular, curved, compressed, downy within, limb cleft in 4 unequal lobes. Stamens didynamous. Ovary conical. Style shorter than the stamens. Stigma 3-lobuled. Seed vessel, 2 multiovulate chambers. Habitat.—Known universally. Blooms in June. Bignoniaceæ. Bignonia Family. Oroxylum Indicum, Vent. (Bignonia Indica, L.; B. quadripinnata, Blanco; Colosanthes Indica, Bl.) Nom. Vulg.—Pinkapinkahan, Pinkapinka, Taghilaw, Abag̃abag̃, Tag.; Abag̃abag̃, Vis. Uses.—The Hindoos consider the trunk bark an astringent and tonic and use it commonly in diarrhœa and dysentery. In Bombay it has a wide use in veterinary practice as an application for the sore backs of the domestic cattle. Sarangadhara recommends for diarrhœa and dysentery the infusion of the roasted bark mixed with infusion of Bombax malabaricum. Dr. Evers experimented with the powder and an infusion of the bark obtaining a strong diaphoretic action. He obtained the same effect with baths containing the bark and reported successful results in thus treating 24 cases of rheumatism. The dose of the powder was 0.30–1 gram a day in 3 doses; the infusion (30 grams bark to 300 boiling water), 90 grams a day in 3 doses. Combined with opium it had more pronounced diaphoretic effects than the compounds of opium and ipecac. The plant possesses no febrifuge properties. Botanical Description.—A tree, 5–6 meters high, trunk straight, hollow, the hollow space containing many thin partitions covered with small points; branches opposite. Leaves 4 times odd pinnate. Leaflets obliquely ovate, acute, entire, glabrous. Flowers in racemes with long, primary peduncles, large, fleshy, lurid, violet color, odor mawkish. Calyx inferior, cylindrical, monophyllous, entire. Corolla much longer than calyx, fleshy, bell-shaped, 5-lobed. Stamens 5, all fertile, fixed on the corolla, nearly equal in height. Style longer than stamens, flattened. Stigma cleft in 2 flat leaves. Silique or pod about 3° long and 2′ wide, flattened, borders grooved and curved downward, containing a great number of seeds encircled by a broad, flat, imbricated wing. Habitat.—Common in many parts of Luzon, in Mindanao, Cebú and Paragua. Pedaliaceæ. Pedalium Family. Sesamum Indicum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Ajonjoli, Sp.; Lig̃á, Tag.; Log̃á, Vis.; Lag̃is, Pam.; Sesamé, Indo-Eng. (Benné Oil, Til Oil, Jinjili Oil.) Uses.—The leaves are emollient and in the Philippines, India and the Southern States of North America they are commonly used to make poultices, as a substitute for linseed. The decoction is prescribed internally as an emmenagogue and demulcent and externally as a lotion. It has the reputation of stimulating the growth of the hair and is used for this purpose quite commonly by the women of India. The seeds are emollient, laxative, diuretic and emmenagogue; they contain an oil to which we shall refer presently. In some countries they form an article of diet; in the Philippines they are much used as a condiment. Waring reports good results in amenorrhœa, adding a handful of the bruised seeds to a hot sitz-bath. Two or 3 dessert-spoonfuls of the seeds eaten fasting and washed down with a glass of water, are very efficient in chronic constipation, both by their mechanical effect and the oil they contain; being non-irritant they are especially indicated in cases of constipation with hemorrhoids. The seeds contain up to 45% of oil known in the Philippines under the name of lana, an Ilocano word meaning “oil.” It is bright yellow, viscid, does not easily become rancid and is used for illuminating purposes in some Philippine provinces. In Japan and among the poor of India it serves as a food; in the latter country it is also very commonly used as a cosmetic, perfumed with various essences and used to anoint the hair and the body after the bath. In America it is given in place of castor oil in doses of 30–60 grams. In pharmacy it may be properly substituted for olive oil, especially in Linimentum Calcis prepared for burns. Botanical Description.—A plant 2–4° high, stem straight, square, grooved. Leaves trifoliate. Leaflets lanceolate, serrate, slightly downy. Common petiole long; secondary petiole very short. Flowers pinkish white, in spikes, each flower bearing 2 small glands. Calyx with 2 bracts at the base, top-shaped, monophyllous, 5 lanceolate teeth. Corolla large, 5-lobed, bell-shaped, expanded in the middle where it is spattered with small spots. Stamens didynamous. Anthers long. Ovary downy, quadrangular. Style same length as stamens. Stigma bifid. Seed vessel quadrangular, elongated, 4 opposite grooves, 4 chambers each containing many small ovoid seeds. Habitat.—Universal. Blooms in October. Acanthaceæ. Acanthus Family. Acanthus ilicifolius, L. Nom. Vulg.—Diliwariw, Dolo-ariw, Tig̃log, Lagiwlagiw, Tag.; Titiw, Vis.; Dulawari, Pam. Uses.—We are not familiar with the medicinal uses of this plant in the Philippines, but believe that its sole use is in the soap-making industry; the ash of the plant is rich in soda and potash salts and lye is prepared from it. In Goa the leaves, rich in mucilage, are used locally in fomentations for rheumatism and neuralgia. Rheede mentions as useful the application of the bruised sprouts to snake bites. Bontius attributes expectorant properties to the plant. The natives of Siam and Cochin China use it as a cordial and as a medicine for paralysis and asthma. In Concan the sweetened decoction of the plant with a little cumin seed is given for dyspepsia with pyrosis. Botanical Description.—A plant about 3° high, stem straight, beset with sharp eminences. Leaves opposite, membranaceous, lanceolate, pinnatifid, large teeth ending in prickles. Petioles very short, 2 thorns at the base. Flowers purplish white in spikes. Calyx double; the outer one of 2 parts, the inner 4. Corolla bell-shaped, lower lip broad, keeled, fleshy, notched above. Upper lip wanting, a notch in its place. Stamens 4, didynamous. Ovary superior, conical. Style of equal length with stamens. Stigma bifid. Seed vessels 2-celled, each cell with 2 heart-shaped, flattened, rough seeds. Habitat.—Very common in regions inundated by salt water. Barleria Prionitis, L. (Barreliera Prionitis, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kokog̃manok, Kulanta, Tag. Uses.—This plant is not used medicinally in the Philippines. The natives of Bombay are accustomed to use its juice to anoint the soles of their feet during the rainy season in order to toughen the skin and prevent fissures due to prolonged maceration. The leaf juice is bitter and acid; it is a favorite with the natives of India in the treatment of the catarrhal fevers common among their children, administered in doses of 2 tablespoonfuls a day mixed with sweetened water. In Concan the dry bark is given for whooping-cough and the juice of the fresh bark in doses of 2 “tolas” (7.60 grams) for anasarca. Dr. Bidie states that the action is diaphoretic and expectorant. Botanical Description.—A plant 2–3° high, stem creeping, the ends rising; enlarged at the joints, glabrous. Leaves smooth, opposite, lanceolate, finely serrate, fringed, somewhat downy below, glabrous above. Petioles short, 4 axillary spines. Flowers straw-color, axillary, sessile, solitary. Calyx deeply cleft in 4 parts, ovate, ending in spines. Corolla funnel-shaped, tube short, throat nude, limb 5-lobed. Stamens 4, didynamous. Ovary 2-celled. Style same length as stamens. Seed-vessel ovate, flattened and sharp-pointed, 2-celled, each cell with a flat, heart-shaped seed. Habitat.—In Guadalupe, Mandaloyon and San Juan del Monte. Blooms in April. Justicia Gendarussa, L. (Gandarussa vulgaris, Nees.; Dianthera subserrata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kapanitulot, Tag.; Bunlaw, Vis. Uses.—In the Philippines this plant has the same applications as the Lagundi or Vitex, soon to be described. In India they give a decoction of the leaves for chronic rheumatism, the action probably being diaphoretic. The juice is employed for the coughs of childhood and externally as a resolvent for enlarged cervical glands. The bark of the young branches has a purplish color; in Java it is considered a good emetic. Botanical Description.—A shrub 5–6° high, stem straight, branches smooth, obscurely 4-angled. Stems and leaves violet color, emitting a disagreeable odor (Blanco). Leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute, glabrous, obtusely serrate. Flowers terminal, white-green, in racemes of 3 sessile flowers with lanceolate bracts. Calyx, 5 long teeth. Corolla, short tube, 2-lipped, upper lip notched, lower lip broad with palate, ending in 3 lobules. Seed vessel with 4 seeds in its lower part. Habitat.—Luzon, Mindanao, Panay. Adhatoda vasica, Nees. (Justicia Adhatoda, L.) Nom. Vulg.—(?) Uses.—The Filipinos are but slightly familiar with this plant and it has no place in their therapeutical armamentarium. In India, however, it is very common and enjoys much reputation in the treatment of catarrhs, the grip, asthma and non-febrile, especially chronic, bronchial affections. The flowers, leaves and roots, but especially the flowers, possess antispasmodic properties and are prescribed in certain forms of asthma; they are bitter and slightly aromatic, and are given in infusion or electuary. Drs. Jackson and Dott have testified from their own experience to the usefulness of the drug in chronic bronchitis, asthma and afebrile catarrh. Dr. Watt states that the natives of Bengal find relief for asthma in smoking the leaves. In Bombay its expectorant action is commonly known and its juice is used, mixed with borax and honey. The dose of the aqueous extract made by evaporating the juice of the leaves, is .25–1 gram. The tincture is preferable, made by dissolving this extract in alcohol; dose 2–4 grams. Its efficiency is increased by the addition of pepper seeds (Waring). The Sanscrit writers recommend for cough, 3.80 grams of the leaf juice with honey. “It is very desirable that further trials be made to test the value of this remedy.”—Pharmacopœia of India. Botanical Description.—A shrub with straight, smooth, ashy-gray trunk. Branches of same color but smoother. Leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute, smooth on both faces, 12–15 cm. long by 3–4 broad, petioles short. Flowers irregular and hermaphrodite in axillary spikes with long peduncles, opposite, large, white, covered with rusty spots, the lower part of the 2 lips purple. Calyx gamosepalous, regular, five deep clefts. Corolla gamopetalous, irregular, short tube, limb 2-lipped, the lower lip ending in a spur. Ovary free, 2-celled, each cell containing 2 ovules. Style filiform, long, inserted in a sort of canal formed by the upper lip of the corolla. Stigma bilobulate. Seed vessel depressed, 4 flattened, lenticular seeds. Habitat.—Luzon and Panay. Rhinacanthus communis, Nees. (Justicia nasuta, L.) Nom. Vulg.—Tagaktagak, Tag.; Nagamulli, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The plant has much reputation in India in the treatment of skin diseases, and indeed its efficiency is great in the stubborn Tinea circinata tropica, known throughout the Orient as “dhobie-itch.” In this disease it is applied for several days to the affected part in the form of a paste composed of the bruised leaves, the juice of the leaves and lemon juice. The fresh root also may be employed. The Hindoo physicians state that the root decoction in milk is aphrodisiac; the root is also regarded as an antidote for the bite of the “cobra da cabelho,” but its virtue is purely imaginary. Of late years the plant has been used in Europe under the name of “tong-pang-chong,” to treat chronic eczema. Liborius made an analysis of the root in the laboratory of Dorpat, separating 13.51% ash and 1.87% rhinocanthin, as well as other ingredients. Rhinocanthin (C14H18O4) is supposed to be the active principle of the root. It is analogous to quinon and resembles in many particulars chrysophanic and frangulic acids. It forms a resinous, amorphous mass, cherry red, odorless and tasteless, slightly soluble in water, forming a mildly alkaline solution in alcohol. It does not yield glucose when boiled with dilute hydrochloric acid. Liborius believes that it exists only in the intercellular spaces of the “root bark.” Botanical Description.—A shrub, about 4° high, stem ash-colored, no spines. Leaves lanceolate, undulate, downy. Flowers white in spikes. Calyx gamosepalous, 5-toothed. Corolla long, filiform, limb 4-lobed, the 3 lower lobes ovate, the upper pointed. Stamens 2. Ovary free, 2 biovulate locules. Style simple. Stigma bifid. Seed vessel club-shaped, 4 seeds in the upper part. Habitat.—Common in the gardens of Manila. Verbenaceæ. Vervain Family. Lippia nodiflora, Rich. (Verbena nodiflora, L.; V. capitata, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Tsatsatsatsahan, Chachachachahan, Tag. Uses.—The Filipinos drink an infusion of the leaves in place of tea, the long Tagalog name meaning “resembling tea.” In India they drink the hot infusion to aid digestion. In some places the decoction of the leaves is given internally as an emollient and diuretic for gonorrhœa. Botanical Description.—A small plant with creeping stem taking root where it touches the ground, obscurely angular, covered with short down. Leaves opposite, smooth, clasping the stem, inversely ovate, serrate only above, slightly downy. Flowers white, slightly purplish, axillary on a common peduncle, in a rough conical head. Corolla somewhat bowed, funnel-form, gaping, throat narrow, limb 4-lobed, one lobe shorter than the rest. Stamens 4, 2 longer. Filament almost wanting. Anthers 4, fertile. Ovary superior, style very short. Stigma semi-globose. Fruit, 2 seeds covered by the pellicle of the ovary. Habitat.—Very common in the rice fields. Tectona grandis, L. Nom. Vulg.—Teca, Sp.; Tikla, Tag.; Dalondón, Yate, Kalayati, Vis.; Teak Tree, Eng. Uses.—The powdered wood made into a paste with water is undoubtedly a useful application in acute dermatitis, especially that due to contact with the caustic oleo-resin of the cashew nut (Anacardium). A decoction of the powder gives good results as a gargle for aphthæ, gingivitis, and other inflammations within the buccal cavity. In India they give internally 6–12 grams as a vermifuge, and for dyspepsia with “heartburn.” The flowers are diuretic according to Endlicher; the bark is astringent; the leaves and the seeds are purgative, the latter yielding an oil which they use in India to stimulate the growth of the hair. Gibson considers the seeds diuretic and quotes two cases where abundant diuresis immediately followed by the application of a poultice of the bruised seeds over the pubis. In Concan they make a sort of extract from the wood and apply it to the yoke sores of the cattle to prevent the growth of maggots. This disinfectant action marks the plant as worthy of further experiment. Rumphius is authority for the statement that the infusion of the leaves is used in cholera. The Chinese make vessels of the wood to preserve their drinking water at sea; the first and second waters are bitter and are thrown away, but after that the water has no disagreeable taste and is said to aid digestion. It has been said that the wood was poisonous because at one time several workmen died from the effects of wounds caused by splinters of the wood, but the statement has not been confirmed by later cases and the deaths were most probably due to a septic infection independent of the chemical composition of the splinters. R. Romanis has extracted a resin from the wood by alcohol; it is soft, and on distillation yields a crystalline body called by the author tectoquinon (C18H10O2), on account of its resemblance to the quinons. It melts at 171° and volatilizes slightly at ordinary temperature. Botanical Description.—A tree with leaves almost round, oval, entire, 30–60 centimeters by 20–40, the under surface covered with hoary down. Petioles very short, flattened. Flowers in panicles. Primary peduncle square. Calyx inferior, bell-shaped, very large when ripe, 5-cleft. Corolla white, longer than calyx, covered with a mealy substance, bell-shaped, 5-lobed. Stamens 5 or 6, inserted in the corolla. Filaments flattened, somewhat longer than the corolla. Anthers semi-globose, a yellow zone below and a black circle above. Ovary free, rounded, 4 locules each with 1 seed. Style same length as stamens. Stigma bilobulate. Drupe globose, woolly, spongy, depressed, covered by the membranous inflated calyx; contains one nut, very hard, 4 apartments each containing one seed. Habitat.—The mountains of Morong and Tanay (of La Laguna Province) bear some specimens. Very common in the island of Negros and in Mindanao. It also grows in the Visayas, Mindora and Paragua. Blooms in September. Vitex trifolia, L. (V. repens, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lagundi, Tag.; Gapasgapas, Vis.; Dangla, Iloc. Vitex Negundo, L. (V. Leucoxylon, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lagundi, Malawin, Tag. Uses.—Both species are used medicinally in the Philippines and both enjoy high repute. A variety of the first that seems to possess the same virtues is the V. repens, Blanco, called lagundig̃ gapag̃ by the Tagalos. V. trifolia is regarded in India as the most powerful species and Bontius has extolled it highly, calling attention to the anodyne, diuretic and emmenagogue properties of the leaves. These are very effective applied in fomentation to rheumatic joints and their use is extensive both in India and the Malay Archipelago. A decoction of the leaves is used locally and as a vapor-bath in the treatment of beriberi. A large earthen pot is filled with leaves and water and brought to a boil; the pot is then placed under a chair in which the patient sits enveloped in a sheet or blanket. If necessary the pot may be removed 2 or 3 times, heated and replaced until abundant sweating is induced. An apparatus to conduct the steam under the chair would be much handier, but it is unsafe to place a small stove or lamp under the chair for fear of setting fire to the cloth. In India and the Philippines there is a peculiar inflammation localized in the soles of the feet and characterized by an intense burning rather than pain, not described in the textbooks, but called by the natives “burning of the feet” (“quemadura del pié” or “ignipedites”); in our own experience and according to the consensus of the physicians of India, the application of these leaves 3 or 4 times a day to the soles of the feet has afforded marked relief. The leaves are heated in an earthen pot without the addition of water, and when sufficiently hot are applied and held in place by a bandage. Dr. W. Ingledew states that the natives of Mysore (south of India) treat rheumatism and febrile catarrhs by steam baths of the decoction of vitex. A decoction of the leaves is in common use in the Philippines, Malay Islands and India as a bath for women in the puerperal state. The dry leaves are smoked for headache and catarrh. According to creditable authority the application of the heated leaves in orchitis produces good results. The root is tonic, febrifuge and expectorant and the fruit nervine and emmenagogue according to the Sanscrit writer. Botanical Description.—V. trifolia is a small tree, 3–4 meters high. The fruit and leaves are said to emit the odor of rosemary. Leaves ternate. Leaflets oval, entire, hoary below, no secondary petioles. Flowers purplish in forked panicle. Corolla bell-shaped with palate. The lower lip 3-lobed, the middle lobe larger; upper lip smaller, 2-lobed. Stamens 4, free, didynamous. Ovary free. Style simple, with stigma-bearing lobules. Berry-like drupe, with 4-celled nut, one seed in each cell. Habitat.—Common on the seashore. Blooms in June. The V. Negundo is a small tree like the preceding, but when it grows in the forest it develops to a tree of the first order, yielding a valuable building wood called molave (Sp.) or more properly molawin. Leaves compound with 5 leaflets. Secondary petioles short. Flowers in dichotomous panicle. Fruit like that of the foregoing species. Clerodendron infortunatum, L. (C. fortunatum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Kasupag̃it, Gubat, Tag.; Salig̃-wak, Vis. Uses.—The fresh juice of the leaves is used in India as a vermifuge, according to K. L. Dey; it is also used as a bitter tonic in malarial fever, especially of children. As a tonic and antipyretic it is certainly worthy of recommendation. Dr. Bholanauth Bose calls attention to this plant as a good substitute for Ophelia chirata, DC. as a tonic and antipyretic. The infusion of the bruised leaves (10 grams to water 300 cc.) is given up to 200 cc. a day in 3 or 4 doses; the tincture (leaves 60 grams, alcohol 90 %, 500 cc.) is given up to 10 grams a day in 5 or 6 doses. Botanical Description.—A shrub with nearly round stem; leaves opposite, ovate, oblong; acute, entire, slightly downy. Flowers terminal in umbellate panicles, the umbellets opposite and each bearing 3 flowerets. Calyx bluish, long, tubular, somewhat expanded in the middle, divided in 5 parts. Corolla twice as long as the calyx, tube filiform, limb 5-lobed. Stamens didynamous, their lower parts grown to the tube of the corolla. Filaments longer than the corolla. Ovary conical. Style of same length as the stamens. Stigma bifid. Berry dry, quadrate, depressed, the shell hard, 4 grooves, 4 cells, each containing a seed. Habitat.—Very common in Manila and in the forests. Labiatæ. Mint Family. Ocimum basilicum, L. (O. Americanum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Solasi, Tag., Pam.; Bonak, Vis.; Sweet Basil, Eng. Ocimum gratissimum, L. (O. virgatum Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lokoloko, Tag., Pam.; Kolonkogon, Vis. Ocimum sanctum, L. (O. flexuosum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Balanay, Tag.; Sacred Basil, Eng. Uses.—All three species possess a characteristic camphoraceous odor and are commonly grouped under the one name, albahacas (sweet basil). Some natives call them solasi and others balanay, but many are able to distinguish the various species correctly. All three have analogous properties, but the most widely used is the O. basilicum. These properties are stimulant, diaphoretic, and expectorant, and the infusion is used commonly for flatulent colic and painful dyspepsia. The dry powdered leaves of the O. sanctum are taken as snuff by the natives of India in the treatment of a curious endemic disease characterized by the presence of small maggots in the nasal secretion; this disease is called peenash, and possibly exists in the Philippines though I have never encountered it. Martins states that in Brazil they use a decoction of the mucilaginous leaves of the O. gratissimum in the treatment of gonorrhœa and Dr. Waitz highly recommends a strong decoction of these leaves for the aphthæ of children, which he claims to have cured by this means after all European drugs had failed. This fact and the action of the snuff above mentioned, demonstrate the antiseptic properties of the plant, due doubtless to its abundant aromatic principles. O. basilicum contains a green essential oil, very aromatic, becoming solid; it is a sort of camphor (C20H166HO, Raybaud) and crystallizes in 4-faced prisms. All the plants are used to prepare aromatic baths for cases of atrophy and debility in children (Waitz) and for the treatment of rheumatism and paralysis. Botanical Description.—O. gratissimum is a plant 2–3° high, stem straight, downy. Leaves medium lanceolate, finely serrate from the middle upwards, with short hairs and transparent dots. Flowers in long terminal racemes. Calyx, upper lip horizontal, round; lower lip 3 pointed parts, the middle one subdivided in two. Corolla yellowish, inverted, one lip cleft in 4 obtuse lobes; the other longer, narrow, serrate. Stamens didynamous, 2 shorter. Anthers semilunar. Stigma bifid. Seeds 4. The O. Americanum has leaves lanceolate, ovate, acute, full of pores, somewhat downy. It is more fragrant than the other species and its flowers are bluish-white in racemes. The O. sanctum is the most sacred plant of the Hindoos, dedicated to Vishnu; its branches are wavy or cauliflexuous, leaves obliquely ovate, obtuse, serrate, nearly glabrous. Habitat.—All species are very common and universally known. Coleus aromaticus, Benth. (C. suganda, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Orégano, Sp.-Fil.; Suganda, Tag.; Marjoram, Eng. (The Sp. and Eng. names are incorrect.) Uses.—The fleshy, aromatic leaves of this plant are bruised and applied locally for the bites of centipedes and scorpions. They are also applied to the temples and forehead for headache, held in place by a bandage. In Cochin China they are used in asthma, chronic bronchitis, epilepsy and other convulsive diseases. The juice of the leaves is a carminative and is given to children suffering with wind colic. Dr. Wight claims to have observed occasional intoxicating effects following its use, but Dymock states that he has never observed such effects. The plant contains a coloring matter, colein (C10H10O3), red, insoluble in ether, soluble in alcohol, slightly soluble in water. On the addition of ammonia the solution changes to purple, then violet, indigo, green, and, finally, greenish-yellow. Another species, the C. atropurpureus, Benth. (C. grandifolius, Blanco), well known in the Philippines by its common name mayana, is used in the treatment of bruises, the bruised fleshy leaves being the part employed; these leaves are downy and dark violet in color. Botanical Description.—Leaves opposite, nearly sessile, cordate, obtuse, downy and very fleshy. Flowers in a quadrangular raceme, each group of these flowerets having a concave scale at the base. Calyx bell-shaped, 2-lipped; the upper lip longer and entire; the lower with 4 narrow teeth. Corolla a pale violet, 5 times longer than the calyx. Stamens didynamous, straight, longer than the corolla. Style bifid. Seeds 4. Habitat.—Universally abundant. Rosmarinus officinalis, L. Nom. Vulg.—Romero, Sp.; Rosemary, Eng. Uses.—This is one of the plants most valued by the Filipinos. Its infusion is used as an eye-wash for slight catarrhal conjunctivitis, applied 3 or 4 times a day. It is one of the aromatic plants used so commonly to bathe women in the puerperal state, and in vapor baths for rheumatism, paralysis and incipient catarrhs. The entire plant is a stimulant and carminative but little used internally; in atonic dyspepsia it has given good results taken in the same form as the infusion of manzanilla. It contains a large per cent. of an essential oil which gives the plant its agreeable odor. This oil enters into the composition of “Cologne Water”; it is said to arrest falling of the hair and is a diffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of 3–5 drops. It is colorless and liquid when fresh, but in time becomes dark and viscid. It combines freely with alcohol and its density is 0.885. Botanical Description.—A plant from 2 to 3° high. Leaves sessile, linear, obtuse, margins revolute, white-hoary beneath. Calyx tubular, 2-lipped. Corolla rose-violet color, gaping; the upper lip concave, 2-lobed; the lower lip longer, 3-lobed. Stamens, 2 fertile and 2 sterile. Style, same length as the stamens. Stigma simple. Fruit, 4 seeds in the depths of the calyx. Habitat.—It is carefully cultivated throughout the Philippines. Anisomeles ovata, R. Br. (Phlomis alba, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Taligharap, Tag.; Jerusalem Sage, Eng. Uses.—The infusion of the leaves is bitter and aromatic and is used in catarrhal inflammations of the stomach and intestines and in intermittent fevers. Used as a vapor-bath it produces abundant diaphoresis, and the infusion given internally has a like effect. The leaves, when distilled, yield an oil which is used as an external application in rheumatism. Botanical Description.—A plant 6° or more high. Root fibrous, trunk and branches enlarged at the joints. Leaves opposite, ovate, obtusely serrate, soft and downy. Flowers pink, verticillate, in opposite clusters around the stem, with several linear and hairy involucres at the base of each cluster. Calyx, 5 sharp teeth. Corolla, 2-lipped; the lower much larger, downy within, 3-lobed, the middle lobe larger and broader, notched at the extremity, and its borders turned downward; the other 2 lateral lobes very small, narrow; the upper lip much shorter and smaller, entire, enveloping the stamens. Stamens didynamous. Style about the same length as the stamens. Stigma bifid. Fruit, 4 small seeds. Habitat.—Very common on the fields of Manila Province. Leucas aspera, Spreng. (Phlomis Zeylanica, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Pansipansi, Solasolasian, Karukansoli, Tag.; Pansipansi, Paypaysi, Vis. Uses.—The bruised leaves are applied to the bites of serpents or poisonous insects. In India they are similarly used. The juice of the leaves is very useful in the treatment of certain skin diseases, especially psoriasis. Botanical Description.—A plant about 2° high, very well known to the natives. Leaves sessile, lanceolate, finely serrate and covered with short hairs. Flowers terminal, white, verticillate, with the characteristics of the mint family. Plantaginaceæ. Plantain Family. Plantago erosa, Wall. (P. crenata and media, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Llantén, Sp.-Fil.; Lantín, Tag.; Plantain, Eng. Uses.—The leaves of this popular plant are the commonest remedy in the Philippines for abscess of the gums. They are bruised and applied with a little lard over the swollen cheek. It is emollient and, in decoction, is used as a substitute for flaxseed. Botanical Description.—This plant is so universally known that there is no fear of confusing it with others. It flourishes as a common weed in the U. S. as well as the Philippines. Nyctaginaceæ. Four-O’Clock Family. Mirabilis Jalapa, L. (M. longiflora, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Maravillas, Suspiros, Sp.-Fil.; Gilalas, Tag.; Four O’Clock, Marvel of Peru, Eng. Uses.—The root is purgative and possesses the same active principles, the same properties and is given in the same dose as jalap. According to the experience of Shoolbred, Hunter, W. O’Shaughnessy and Ainslie, its purgative action is weak and uncertain and therefore unworthy of use as a substitute for jalap. The bruised leaves are used as poultices to hasten suppuration, but according to Waring they are capable of causing dermatitis. Botanical Description.—The flowers open toward the end of the day and close again at sunrise. The root is blackish and spindle-shaped. The stem smooth, branches forked. Leaves opposite, lanceolate-cordate, acute, somewhat downy along the borders and the upper surface. Petioles short. Flowers fragrant, almost constantly blooming, of different colors even in the same plant, terminal, in umbels. Pedicels very short. Calyx persistent, 5-toothed. Corolla superior, very long, its tube downy, funnel-form, limb 5-lobed. Stamens 5, longer than the corolla. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma globose. Nut small, black, globose, many-ribbed, full of a mealy substance. Habitat.—Common in gardens. Amaranthaceæ. Amaranth Family. Amaranthus spinosus, L. Nom. Vulg.—Kilitis, Orayi, Tag.; Ayantoto, Pam.; Kalitis, Tilites, Bayag̃-bayag̃, Vis.; Kuanton, Iloc.; Thorny Amaranth, Eng. Uses.—The entire plant is emollient and its principal use is as a poultice for inflammations, bruises, etc. The decoction of the root is diuretic and antiphlogistic and is used in Mauritius (30 grams root to 750 cc. water) as an internal remedy for gonorrhœa; indeed it is there regarded as a specific for that disease, checking the discharge and the “ardor urinæ.” It should be continued till the cure is complete. The bruised leaves are used locally for eczema. Botanical Description.—A plant 2–3° high of a reddish color. Leaves alternate, lanceolate, broad, notched at the apex, wavy, glabrous. Petioles with a pair of spines in their axils. Flowers small, yellow-green, in round axillary clusters and in long terminal spikes. The pistillate flowers are sometimes separated from the staminate, sometimes mixed with them in the lower part of the spike. Staminate: No corolla, calyx 2–5 parts, stamens 4–5. Pistillate: Style and stigma 2 or 3, otherwise the same as the staminate. Seed vessel with 1 seed. Habitat.—Common in all parts. Blooms in October. Achyranthes obtusifolia, Lam. (A. aspera, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Hangor, Hangot, Dokotdekot, Libay, Tag.; Angod, Pam. Uses.—The plant has astringent and diuretic properties; the latter were observed by Dr. Cornish, who communicated the facts to Waring, calling special attention to the good service the drug had afforded him in dropsy. Other physicians in India have confirmed these observations of Cornish. The decoction is made of 60 grams of the entire plant to 750 cc. water, boiled till reduced one-half and strained under pressure. Dose, 60 cc. every 2 hours till diuresis is induced. The ashes of this plant, like those of the Amaranthus spinosus, L., contain a large quantity of potassa, and are used for washing clothes; on this account it has received its Sanscrit name Apamarga (the washer). The ashes are also mixed in an infusion of ginger and given internally in dropsy. The flowers are bruised and applied to the bites of snakes and other poisonous animals. In India there is a superstition that carrying these flowers about the person will keep off scorpions. Botanical Description.—A plant about 3° high, the stem angular and downy. Leaves opposite, downy, clasping the stem, lanceolate, very obtuse and wavy. Flowers bent downward in a long spike bearing many flowerets. Calyx, 5 tough scales. Corolla wanting. Nectary much smaller than the calyx, monophyllous, 5-lobed. Stamens 5. Ovary top-shaped, upper part somewhat concave. Style same length as stamens. Stigma coarse, bifid. Fruit, a seed covered with 2 membranes, one enveloping it completely, the outer one adherent in only one part. Habitat.—Common in Luzon. Blooms in November. Chenopodiacæ. Goosefoot Family. Chenopodium ambrosioides, L. Nom. Vulg.—Alpasotes, Sp.-Fil.; Pasotis, Apasotis, Tag.; American Worm-seed, Mexican Tea, Eng. Uses.—This plant is a native of Mexico. It has a peculiar, somewhat offensive odor and an acrid, aromatic taste due to an essential oil resembling peppermint (?). According to Padre Mercado, “When the seeds are taken with wine, sensation is so dulled that the drinker may be whipped without feeling the lashes, and even if put to the torment, does not feel it.” These properties, if true, make this plant one of the most useful in the Philippines. The entire plant is stimulant. The infusion, given internally, causes sweating, excites the circulation, is diuretic, tonic, stomachic, and useful as well as an antispasmodic in nervous troubles. The leaves are employed in making the infusion, 8 grams to 200 of boiling water. It is widely used in bronchial catarrhs and in asthma on account of its sudorific and expectorant action. It seems also to possess emmenagogue properties. The seeds yield on distillation a yellow essential oil with a strong and disagreeable odor, density 0.908. Both seeds and flowers are vermifuge, and are used as such in Brazil in doses of 8 grams in infusion or with an equal dose of castor oil. The anthelmintic dose of the essential oil is 5–15 drops with powdered sugar. Rilliet and Barthez recommend the following potion for infantile chorea: Leaves of chenopodium 4 grams. Water 500 grams. Make an infusion and add syrup of orange flowers 50 grams. Dose, several tablespoonfuls a day. Botanical Description.—A plant 2° high; stem beset with hairs, many-angled. Leaves lanceolate, varying from entire to cut-pinnatifid. Flowers green, sessile, axillary, in small clusters. Calyx 5-parted. Corolla wanting. Stamens 5. Filaments flattened, inserted near the center of the flowers opposite the parts of the calyx. Anthers in 2 globose parts. Ovary superior, globose, depressed, unilocular, uniovulate. Style none. Stigmas, 2, 3 or 4, short, divergent. Fruit a lenticular seed covered by the membrane of the ovary. Habitat.—Common in gardens and fields. Blooms in May. Aristolochiaceæ. Birthwort Family. Aristolochia Indica, L. Nom. Vulg.—Timbag̃an, Malaubi, Tag.; Indian Birthwort, Eng. Uses.—The root has a wide use in medicine in the Philippines; it is bitter, of a nauseating odor and has the reputation of being a powerful antidote for the bites of poisonous serpents and insects. It has further use in the treatment of malarial fever, in dyspepsia, and in the flatulent colic of teething children. It is regarded as tonic and emmenagogue. In various forms of diarrhœa it appears to be effective and Dr. Gibson states that it is useful in intestinal disorders. In the Philippines it is not only given internally but also externally applied over the abdomen, mixed with hot cocoanut oil (10 grams of the powdered root to 100 oil). The first Portuguese settlers in India called the drug “Cobra Root,” because the natives regarded it as an antidote for the bite of the terrible “Cobra da Capello.” This reputation, however, seems not to have been deserved, judging from the fearful mortality in India and Ceylon due to the bite of the cobra. Dr. Imlach, a surgeon of Singapore, states that in one season in one collectorate, Shikapore, no less than 306 cases of snake bites were officially reported, the mortality being 63, or about 20.58 per cent. Other reports make it safe to conclude that in the entire province during the year no less than 300 deaths were due to this cause alone. Dr. Waring believes that if an antidote for snake bite exist in the vegetable kingdom it will most probably be found in the natural order Aristolochiaceæ. In North India this drug is used as emmenagogue and anti-arthritic, and in Banda for intermittent fevers and intestinal disorders. The juice of the leaves is emetic. The dose of the powdered root is 3–5 grams daily. Botanical Description.—A twining shrub, with leaves heart-shaped, ovate, acute, glabrous. Petioles short. Flowers dark reddish-gray, in panicles. Calyx wanting. Corolla globose below, the tube cylindrical, expanding at the top. Anthers 6, in pairs. Filaments, none. Styles 6, very coarse, a membrane at the base including all. Stigmas simple. Seed vessel inferior, 6-ribbed, 6 cells and many winged seeds. The seed vessel after casting the seeds resembles a pair of balance scales with its little plates or pans. Hence the Tagalo name Timbag̃an meaning “balance.” Habitat.—In Luzon and Panay. Blooms in November. Piperaceæ. Pepper Family. Piper Betle, L. (Chavica Betle and C. auriculata, Miq.; Piper Betel, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Hojas de buyo, Sp.-Fil.; Itmó, Tag.; Mamin, Bic.; Buyo, Mamón, Vis.; Samat, Pam.; Betel Pepper, Eng. Uses.—A masticatory, used all over the extreme Orient, is composed of the leaves of this plant, a little slaked oyster-shell lime and a rounded slice of the bonga or areca nut; the Filipinos call this combination bayo, though the name is not of native origin; the Tagalos call it hitsú. The use of buyo by careless persons is decidedly repugnant, for the mixture of the lime and the pigment of the bonga imparts a blood-red or rather brick-red color to the saliva which they spit in mouthfuls into the streets and other public places with no thought of the feelings of others. Unless the mouth is carefully cleaned the teeth become encrusted with a sort of black enamel and the breath assumes a detestable odor. When used in small quantities and with proper toilet of the mouth, and this is the common practice among the Filipinos, buyo seems to be a very useful preservative of the teeth and a gingival and stomachic tonic. These properties are readily understood when we consider that the lime is antacid, the bonga astringent and tonic and the betel aromatic and stimulant. The buyo leaf plays a very important part in the therapeutics of the infant of the Philippines: in its indigestions, colics and diarrhœas the heated leaves are applied to the abdomen previously anointed with hot cocoanut oil. In bronchitis and laryngitis the heated leaves are applied over the chest or neck after rubbing the parts with oil. It undoubtedly produces good effects and the physicians of India recommend it in the same cases and in the same form as in the Philippines. Applied to the breasts of parturient women it dries up the milk and in the same way tends to reduce any glandular enlargement. Dr. Kleinstück of Java recommends the essence of the leaves in all sorts of catarrhs and as an antiseptic in doses of one drop to 140 of the vehicle. This essence is obtained by distillation; it is dark in color, has an acrid taste and an odor resembling that of tea. Its density is 1.020. The dried leaves contain one-half per cent. of the essence and it is probable that the fresh ones contain a greater proportion. Botanical Description.—A plant with yellow flowers and scandent stem, climbing straight up trees or artificial supports. Leaves cleft at the base, acute, entire, glabrous, dark green. According to Blanco it is cultivated best in somewhat sandy soil. Pasay, near Manila, and Bauang, in Batangas, furnish a leaf most highly appreciated. Piper nigrum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Pimienta, Sp.; Paminta, Malisa, Tag.; Black Pepper, Eng. Uses.—The berry-like fruit of the pepper is more extensively used as a condiment in cooking than in the treatment of disease. Used in moderation, however, it is of considerable value as a convenient stomachic and aid to digestion in tropical countries where the digestive functions readily become sluggish. Its abuse may lead to serious consequences, such as inflammation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, of the portal system and the liver itself. Pepper is used as a febrifuge in the various forms of malarial fevers, in the form of granules of 8 or 10 berries in a cup of brandy and anise (Spanish); this is taken by the patient in one dose at the beginning of the cold stage and followed by large quantities of water to relieve the thirst caused by the pepper. This treatment causes the cold stage to rapidly subside and more rapidly induces and intensifies the sweating stage. It is said that no further attack of fever follows. Piperin (C17H19NO3) is febrifuge and is given in pill form internally in doses of 30–60 centigrams; the action of the crude drug is evidently due to this neutral principle. Botanical Description.—The plant is a perennial, climbing shrub. Leaves oval, tapering at both extremities, 7-nerved. Flowers yellow, in a spike. Stigmas 2, bifid. Fruit globose, with one seed. Habitat.—The dried fruit of the pepper is universally familiar. It was at one time cultivated in the Philippines, especially in Batangas, and Gen. Basco promulgated a series of orders to encourage its cultivation. Padre Gainza, afterward Bishop of Nueva Cáceres, wrote a report about its cultivation, but since then the subject has entirely disappeared from notice. Chloranthaceæ. Chloranth Family. Chloranthus officinalis, Bl. (C. Indicus, Wight.; C. inconspicuus, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Unknown. Uses.—All parts of the plant are aromatic. The leaves and stems lose this property after drying, but the roots, if properly dried, preserve it for a long time. They have a camphoraceous odor and bitter, aromatic taste, reminding one of that of Aristolochia Serpentaria. The mountaineers of Java use an infusion of the powdered root and the bark of the Cinnamomum Culilowan to treat puerperal eclampsia. Combined with carminatives like anise and onion, they use it with some success in virulent small-pox of children. The infusion seems to be efficacious in fevers accompanied by debility and suppression of the function of the skin. It has also been prescribed in the intermittent fevers of Java, mixed with an infusion of the leaves of the Cedrela Toona. Blume states that it is one of the most powerful stimulants known. Botanical Description.—A plant 3–4° high. Stem quadrangular. Leaves opposite, broad, lanceolate, serrate, with stiff-pointed teeth and somewhat scaly beneath. Petioles very short, clasping the stem at their base, with 2 intermediate stipules ending in two awl-shaped points. Flowers compound in axillary spikes, which bear the flowerets in 2 ranks, each flower with a keeled bract. The corolla (if it may be so called) a fleshy, 3-lobed lamina. Perianth wanting. Receptacle dome-shaped. Anthers 4, inserted on the surface of the lamina, 2-valved. Ovary 1-celled, with 1 ovule. Style short. Berry-like fruit, globose, with 1 seed covered by a somewhat brittle membrane. Habitat.—La Laguna and other provinces of Luzon. Blooms in September. Lauraceæ. Laurel Family. Cinnamomum pauciflorum, Nees. (Laurus culilaban, Var., Blanco.) C. tamala, Nees. (L. culilaban, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg. (of both).—Kalig̃ag, Makalig̃ag, Tag., Vis.; Kandaroma, Iloc; Cassia Lignea or Cassia, Eng. Uses.—The bark of both species is known in pharmacy as Chinese cassia or Chinese cinnamon (cassia cinnamon). Indeed it is very like the cinnamon of Ceylon, comes in curled quills, has the same odor and taste though not so delicate; but it is darker in color, with a surface less clean and smooth. Its chemical composition is identical with that of the latter and nowadays it forms an important article of commerce. Cinnamon renders good service in therapeutics as a stimulant of the digestive tract and a heart tonic. In the atonic diarrhœas so common in the Philippines a tincture of cinnamon in doses of 8–10 grams a day, or the powder in cases where alcohol was contraindicated, have given me unhoped-for results. In Spain and the Philippines it is very popular as a condiment in the kitchen of the confectionery and as a flavor for chocolate; in fact in those countries it takes the place of vanilla in France. It enters into the composition of several elixirs and compound tinctures, such as “Botot’s Water” (dentifrice), “Elixir of Garus” (tonic stimulant), “Balsam of Fioraventi” (external stimulant), laudanum and the elixir of the Grande Chartreuse (diffusible stimulant). Lately it has been demonstrated that the essence is a powerful antiseptic, in the presence of which typhoid fever bacilli cannot develop. Botanical Description.—A tree, 15–20° high. Leaves opposite, lanceolate, 3-nerved, entire, glabrous. Flowers yellow, paniculate, umbellate. Common peduncles very long, those of the flowerets long. Calyx none. Corolla, 6 ovate, hairy petals. Stamens 9; 6 external to the rest and bearing the anthers, 4 on each filament, 2 below the others; the 3 inner stamens bear 2 anthers each. In the second species the flowers form loose, terminal panicles. Stamens 9; 6 filaments inserted on the receptacle, spatulate, each bearing 4 anthers on the inferior face; the other 3 filaments thick, each bearing 4 anthers. Between the last filaments are 8 nearly globose glandules. Habitat.—Both species are common in the forests of Luzon. The first species blooms in May, the second in January. Cassytha filiformis, L. Nom. Vulg.—Malabohok. Uses.—This plant has no therapeutical uses in the Philippines. In Senegal it is employed, according to Dujardin-Beaumetz, mixed with lard to treat urethritis; its action is to decrease the ardor urinæ. It is not stated whether this mixture is used internally or externally. In Cochin China the same writer states that it is used as an antisyphilitic. In India it is used for the piles and as an alterative for bilious disorders. It possibly acts as a circulatory stimulant. Botanical Description.—A slender, thread-like, cylindrical vine, without leaves, that covers the trees like a mantle, so luxuriant is its growth. Flowers yellow, in axillary spikes. Calyx small, 3 sepals. Corolla, 3 fleshy concave petals. Stamens 12 in 4 verticils, 9 fertile and 3 inner sterile. Ovary 1-celled, 1-ovuled. Style cylindrical. Drupe globose, 1–2″ in diameter, covered by a fleshy envelope, formed by the receptacle. Seeds without albumen. Habitat.—Luzon, Mindanao, Cebú, on the seashore. Euphorbiaceæ. Spurge Family. Euphorbia pilulifera, L. (E. capitata, Lam.; E. hirta, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Golondrina, Sp.-Fil.; Gatasgatas, Batobatonis, Sayikan, Tag.; Buyayawa, Tawawa, Bowi, Vis.; Malismalis, Sisiwhan, Bolobotones, Magatas, Pam. Uses.—This plant has a reputation in the Philippines as a hæmostatic of great efficiency, for which purpose the whole plant is crushed and applied as a poultice over the wound. Like all members of this family it abounds in milky juice. We have had no occasion to employ it as a hæmostatic, but do not doubt its action in view of the effect that it exercises on the circulation and the heart when given internally. In toxic doses experiment has demonstrated that it kills animals by suspension of the respiratory movements and those of the heart, which at first beats faster but gradually more slowly. It has no effect upon any other organ and is eliminated by the liver. Matheson recommends it as an antispasmodic and has employed it also in dyspnœa of cardiac origin. I have used it in both these conditions in Manila with highly satisfactory results. I have found the most convenient form of administration to be the tincture in doses of 15–40 drops a day given in an infusion of althæa every 3 or 4 hours; the vehicle should be used liberally as it diminishes the irritant action of the euphorbia on the stomach. A decoction of 15 grams of the plant to 2 liters of water may be given in doses of from 6 to 12 tablespoonfuls daily. A proper dose of the alcoholic extract is 10 centigrams in 24 hours. Dr. Daruty, of Mauritius, gives the following formula: Euphorbia pilulifera dried in the shade 30 grams. Water 1½ liters. Boil till reduced to 1 liter, cool and add: Rum or cognac 30 grams. Dose.—1 wineglassful 3 times a day. This decoction relieves the most obstinate asthma, as well as cough and bronchial irritation. It is necessary to use the entire plant. The decoction is usually given in the morning, fasting, in the middle of the afternoon and at bedtime. In very stubborn cases another dose may be given in the middle of the night. Frequently the relief is immediate and in some cases a liter of the decoction is enough to effect a cure. If the symptoms return, it is easy to abort them; they are less distressing and, according to the statements of patients, the medicine “gives them air.” Dr. Hicks Bunting found, in an analysis of the drug, 60 per cent. of insoluble residue, wax, “caucho,” resin, tannin, sugar, albuminoids, oxalate of calcium and other salts. Dr. Marsset states that the active principle is soluble in water, in dilute alcohol; insoluble in ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, and turpentine, but does not give the reaction. The toxic dose is 1 gram of dried plant for each kilogram of weight of the animal. Botanical Description.—A small creeping plant with milky juice. Stem 1–2° high, cylindrical, hairy and reddish in color. Leaves opposite, obliquely ovate, rhomboid, serrate, hairy. Petioles very short. Two pointed stipules at the base. Flowers yellowish in hemispherical umbels of 5 divisions, each subdivided in 2. Involucre universal. Calyx bell-shaped, laciniate, in 5 parts. Corolla, 5 petals, inserted on the divisions of the calyx, fleshy, orbicular, with an orbicular appendix at the base, concave and differing from the corolla in color. Stamens 8, inserted on the base of the calyx; filaments unequal in length, each bearing 2 anthers. Four filaments lacking anthers. Ovary with stalk longer than the flower, curved downward. Styles 3, bifid. Stigmas simple. Seed vessels 3, united, hairy, 3-angled, each bearing 1 red globose seed with a wrinkled surface. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the islands and well known to the natives. The name by which it is best known in Manila is “golondrina.” Euphorbia neriifolia, L. (E. ligularia, Roxb.; E. pentagona, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Sorosoro, Sorog-sorog, Bait, Tag., Pam.; Karambauaya, Iloc.; Lengua de perro, Sp.-Fil. Uses.—The principal medicinal use of this plant in the Philippines is the introduction of the hot juice of its fleshy leaves into the external auditory canal in cases of otorrhœa or of simple earache, whatever its cause. The root is regarded in India as an antidote for snake bite and, indeed, the plant is sacred to Munsa, the snake divinity. During the months of July and August in some parts of India the natives make offerings of rice, milk and sugar to this sacred tree every Tuesday and Thursday, praying for protection from the bites of serpents. The leaves contain an abundance of milky juice, acrid and very active, used in the treatment of several skin diseases. Like the species E. pilulifera it possesses antiasthmatic properties; Dr. S. C. Amcobury reports 6 cases treated with satisfactory results. Owing to the acrid quality of the juice great care should be maintained both in its internal and external use. The Sanscrit authors regard it as purgative and usually administer it with other drugs of the same action to increase its effect. Ainslie states that the native herb-doctors of India give the juice in intestinal obstruction and in the œdema of malarial cachexia. The dose is 1.25 grams in 24 hours given in 300 cc. of sweetened water in divided doses. This dose is, in my opinion, dangerous; 40–60 centigrams a day is more prudent. Botanical Description.—A small tree, from 5 to 6° high. Trunk erect, jointed, 5-sided, at the angles 2 rows of thorns. Leaves spatulate, fleshy. Flowers yellowish. Calyx bell-shaped, 5-lobed. Corolla, numerous imbricated, spatulate petals with ravelled or fringed ends. Stamens in groups. Styles 3. Stigma coarse. Seed vessel, 3 carpels on a stalk. Habitat.—In all parts of Luzon. Euphorbia Tirucalli, L. Nom. Vulg.—Consuelda, Sp.-Fil.; Katwit, Suelda, Tag. Uses.—The milky juice of this species is very caustic. It is used chiefly in India mixed with oil as an embrocation for rheumatism; given internally it is regarded as an antisyphilitic. Dr. J. Shortt states that it is an excellent alterant in syphilis in dose of 30 centigrams, morning and evening. It is further employed in malarial hypertrophy of the spleen, in asthma and as a purgative; in a word the same virtues are attributed to it as to the foregoing species. Botanical Description.—Small trees, 9–12° high. Trunk erect. Branches cylindrical, stumpy (not tapering), several very small leaves at the ends. Flowers yellowish, in umbels. Calyx, 5 rounded, fleshy sepals. Corolla, 5 groups of woolly hairs on the divisions of the calyx. Stamens 5, inserted on the sepals, with double or irregular anthers. Seed vessel, 3 carpels each with one seed. Habitat.—Very common, especially in the suburbs of Manila where they serve as hedges. Phyllanthus reticulatus, Müll. (Cica decandra, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Tinatinaan, Tintatintahan, Malinta, Tag.; Sug̃ot-olag̃, Vis. Uses.—The natives eat the little berries of this species, which are dark purple before and black after maturity, and use their juice for ink. The leaves are diuretic and refreshing; the bark alterant. In the bazaars of India the bark is sold commonly in pieces 1° long and as thick as the wrist; its taste is slightly sweet, color dark and the alterative dose of its decoction is 120–150 grams a day. In Concan they make a compound pill of the leaf-juice, powdered cubebs and camphor, to be dissolved in the mouth for ulcerated, bleeding or scorbutic gums. The juice is also given internally for urticaria. Botanical Description.—Small trees, 12° or more high, with leaves pinnate, oval, entire, alternate, glabrous, downy when young. Common petiole, 2 stipules at the base. Flowers monœcious. Staminate: calyx, 5 colored sepals; no corolla; filaments 4, coarse, somewhat shorter than the calyx, the middle one thicker and 2-parted; anthers 10, 4 on the middle filament and two on each of the others. Pistillate: calyx and corolla same as staminate; nectary, 5 glandules on the base of the ovary. Fruit, a black berry seated within the calyx, crowned with 2 erect styles, 6 or 8 compartments each with a single seed. Habitat.—Grows everywhere and is well known. Phyllanthus Niruri, L. P. urinaria, L. Nom. Vulg.—Hierba de San Pablo, de San Pedro, Sp. Uses.—This species is not used medicinally in the Philippines, but in India is given for its diuretic effect and has great repute in the treatment of genito-urinary diseases, dropsy and gonorrhœa. The infusion of the leaves of P. Niruri with Fenugreek seeds is a highly prized remedy for chronic dysentery, mentioned by Ainslie. The leaves are bitter and tonic and in Bombay they are in common use in gonorrhœa to correct the acidity of the urine. Bruised and mixed with salt they make a sort of jelly frequently used as an application for itch; without salt the same is used for contusions. The dose of the leaf juice of both species, for internal use, is 15 grams a day in divided doses. A decoction of the entire plant well dried and powdered, is given for jaundice in doses of 5 grams a day. The milky juice of the stem is useful in the local treatment of ulcers. The bruised root is employed in Concan for neuralgia. Botanical Description.—P. Niruri is an herb with straight stem. Leaves alternate, pinnate with stylet in place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets nearly oval, glabrous, 2 stipules at the base. Flowers monœcious, greenish, axillary; the staminate growing along the common petiole above the pistillate. Staminate: Calyx, 5 lanceolate, entire sepals; no corolla; 1 filament with 1 anther. Pistillate: Calyx and corolla as above; ovary free, 3 biovulate cells; style with 2 stigma-bearing branches. Fruit capsular, globose. P. urinaria may be distinguished by its sessile flowers and reddish stem. Habitat.—Very common in Manila and all over Luzon. Jatropha Curcas, L. Nom. Vulg.—Tuba, Tag.; Kasla, Vis.; Tawatawa, Iloc. (Seeds called “English Physic Nuts” in India.) Uses.—The milky juice of the trunk and branches is a drastic purgative, too active for safety as a physic. Mixed with water it is used as a wash for atonic ulcers. The seeds yield 25–30 per cent. of a yellowish oil, more active than castor oil as a purgative but less certain. Ten or twelve of the former equal in effect 30 to 40 drops of the latter. Its density is 0.919, and it differs from castor oil in being only slightly soluble in absolute alcohol. In some parts of the Philippines it is used for purposes of illumination, and it is exported to Europe to adulterate soaps and candles. It contains a little stearin which begins to be deposited at 9° and is entirely solidified at 0°. The fruit is strongly purgative, and this action is not due to the oil but to a peculiar resin so active that 3 fruits produce drastic effects. Whatever purgative action the oil possesses is due to the resin which it contains in solution. It seems, therefore, preferable to treat the seeds with alcohol, thus dissolving the resin, and use the tincture thus obtained in place of the oil. The natives use the plant to intoxicate the fish in ponds and sluggish streams. The seeds of the species J. multifida, L., also called tuba in Tag., and mana, are likewise purgative in their action. Dr. Waring saw a case of poisoning with the fruit; the patient, a young man, suffered violent vomiting, intense pain in the stomach and head, and marked prostration. He recovered under the use of lime juice and stimulants. Botanical Description.—The J. Curcas is a small tree growing as high as 9°. Leaves alternate, cordate, glabrous, 3–5 cut-lobed. Flowers yellowish-green, monœcious, in terminal umbels, staminate and pistillate flowers mingled without order. Staminate: Calyx, 5 unequal sepals; corolla bell-shaped, 5 petals, woolly within, a small notch at the end, bent downward; stamens 10, in 2 whorls of 5. Pistillate: Calyx and corolla as above; several tongue-like staminodes replace the stamens; ovary free, oblong, 3-celled, 1 ovule in each cell; style 3-branched. Seed vessel fleshy, of 3 capsules, each bearing 1 oval, coriaceous seed. Habitat.—Luzon and Visayas. Aleurites Moluccana, Willd. (A. triloba, Forst. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lumbán, Kapili, Tag.; Belgaum or Indian Walnut, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The kernels are rich in oil which is used for illumination and the manufacture of soap. For industrial purposes it is superior to linseed oil, according to the report of the Madras Drug Committee. Dr. O’Rocke states that in doses of 1–2 ounces it acts as a gentle and sure purgative, producing copious bilious evacuations after 3–6 hours, without causing nausea, colic or other similar effects. The municipal physician of Sampaloc, Señor Xerez, states that he has frequently used this oil in Manila, as a purgative, and he agrees perfectly with Dr. O’Rocke as to its effect. D. Anacleto del Rosario, the distinguished Filipino chemist, tells me that he once witnessed a case of poisoning by the fruit of the lumbán, the patient being a native boy. Doubtless the milky juice, so active in all the Euphorbiaceæ, was the cause of the symptoms. It is true that the kernel causes colic and copious alvine discharges. Nellino’s chemical analysis of the seeds is as follows: Water 5.25 Fatty matter 62.97 Cellulose 28.99 Mineral matter 2.79 The ashes contain the following matters: Lime 28.69% Magnesia 6.01% Potash 11.23% Phosphoric acid 20.30% The oil is yellow, syrupy, transparent, odorless, insipid. Botanical Description.—A tree with leaves bunched or clustered, 3–5 lobulate with as many nerves. Petioles about as long as the leaves. Flowers white, terminal in panicles, the pistillate mixed with the more numerous staminate flowers. Staminate: Calyx monophyllous, cylindrical, 2-toothed; corolla, 5 linear petals twice as long as the calyx; stamens 20 or more, joined in a column at their bases. Pistillate: Calyx and corolla as above; ovary of 2 or 3 uniovulate locules, encircled by a disk; style 2-or 3-branched. Seed vessel large, ovate, compressed, fleshy, 2 sutures at right angles, 2 compartments, in each a hard nut. Habitat.—Grows all over Luzon and is well known to the natives. Croton Tiglium, L. (C. glandulosum, C. muricatum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Tuba kamaisa, Tag.; The Purging Croton, Eng. Uses.—The fruit is used by the Filipinos to intoxicate the fish in ponds and sluggish streams. The seeds contain an oil that is official in all Pharmacopœias as one of the most powerful hydragogue cathartics. As it is intensely irritating it should never be administered alone but combined with other substances, such as castor oil, or in pill form. The internal dose is 1 to 2 drops. It is considered a specific for lead colic and is indicated when not only purgation but active irritation of the digestive canal is desired. Applied to the skin it is a strong irritant causing rapid and painful vesication. Great care should be exercised not to raise the hands to the eyes after touching the oil, as serious inflammation might result. Botanical Description.—A small tree, 8–9° high, with rough trunk. Leaves alternate, ovate, acute, minutely serrate, both surfaces beset with sharp hairs. Flowers yellowish-white, monœcious. Staminate: Fewer than the pistillate, growing above them; calyx 5-toothed; corolla, 5 woolly petals; stamens 16, joined in the center. Pistillate: Calyx 5-toothed; corolla much less developed than in the staminate; ovary free, 3 uniovulate locules; styles 3, bifid. Seed vessel dry, with thin envelope bristling with stiff hairs; 3 carpels each containing a seed. Habitat.—Common in Luzon. Acalypha Indica, L. (A. Caroliniana, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Not known. Uses.—This plant is not used medicinally in the Philippines, but is very common in India. Dr. G. Bidie, of Madras, states that the expressed juice of the leaves is in great repute, wherever the plant grows, as an emetic for children and is safe, certain and speedy in its action. Like ipecacuanha it seems to have little tendency to act on the bowels or depress the vital powers, and it decidedly increases the secretion of the pulmonary organs. Probably an infusion of the dried leaves or an extract prepared from the green plant would retain all its active properties. The dose of the expressed juice for an infant is a teaspoonful. Dr. A. E. Ross speaks highly of its use as an expectorant, ranking it in this respect with senega; he found it especially useful in the bronchitis of children. He also makes favorable report of a cataplasm of the leaves as a local application to syphilitic ulcers and as a means of relieving the pain attendant on the bites of venomous insects. The alleged purgative action of the root noticed by Ainslie is confirmed by Dr. H. E. Busteed, who reports having used the expressed juice of the root and leaves as a laxative for children. Langley, a military surgeon, states that in Canara the natives employ the leaf juice in congestive headache, soaking pledgets of cotton with it and introducing them into the nasal fossæ; the resultant nose bleed relieves the headache. The powder of the dry leaves is dusted on ulcers and putrid sores. In asthma and bronchitis, both of children and adults, Langley has used this plant with good results, and he recommends 1.25–3.50 grams of the tincture (100 grams of the fresh plant to 500 of alcohol, 90°) repeated several times a day; the effect is expectorant, nauseant and, in large doses, emetic. It must be noted that only the young, growing plants are active. The flowers of another species, A. hispida, Burm., called bugos in Tag. and Vis., is used in India for the dysentery. Botanical Description.—A little plant, about 3° high. Leaves alternate, broad, lanceolate, 5-nerved, serrate from middle to apex. Petioles much longer than the leaves, 2 stipules at their bases. Flowers greenish, monœcious in axillary spikes, pedunculate, as long as the leaves, crowned by a prolongation of the axis in the form of a cross. Staminate: Numerous, in upper part of spike; calyx 4 parts; no corolla; stamens 8–16, small, free. Pistillate: Less in number, at the base of the spike; perianth of 3 imbricated leaflets; ovary, 3 uniovulate locules; style, 3 branches which also subdivide. Capsule 3-celled, each cell containing a globose seed with cicatrix. Habitat.—Luzon, Panay and Mindanao. Blooms in October. Echinus Philippensis, H. Baillon. (Croton Philippense, Lamk.; Rottlera tinctoria, Roxb.; Mallotus Philippensis, Müll.) Nom. Vulg.—Banato, Tag.; Buas, Vuas, Iloc.; Monkey-face Tree, Kamala or Kamala Dye, Indo-Eng. Uses.—The capsular fruit of this plant is thickly beset with reddish glands and hairs, which, when brushed off and gathered in powder form, constitute the kamala dye of the Hindoos. It was mentioned by the Arabian physicians of the tenth century under the names of Kanbil and Wars. In India the powder is highly valued as a yellow dye-stuff for silk. Medicinally it is used as an anthelmintic, the English physician Mackinnon, of the Bengal Hospital, having been the first to scientifically prove this property; he reported that it was successful in expelling the tape-worm. It is now official in the Pharmacopœia of India and also in the U. S. P. as an anthelmintic and purgative; in Switzerland it is commonly given to expel the bothriocephalus which abounds there, the lake fish acting as hosts. The dose recommended by the Pharmacopœia of India is 8–12 grams, divided in 3 or 4 doses. This amount sometimes causes nausea and colic; in the third or fourth stool the tænia is commonly expelled in a lifeless condition. Dujardin-Beaumetz advises a dose of 30 grams of castor oil in case the tænia has not been expelled 2 hours after the last dose of kamala. The powder is efficacious but the tincture seems to be surer; the dose is 6 grams for children and 20 for adults, given in divided doses in aromatic water every hour for 6 hours. This tincture is prepared by macerating 200 grams of kamala in 500 cc. alcohol for 7 days; then filtering with expression and adding enough alcohol to complete the 500 cc. The powder is also used in India as a local application in herpes circinata. It is insoluble in water; in ether and alcohol it yields 80% of a red resin. Anderson noted that a concentrated ethereal solution of kamala after a few days formed a solid crystalline mass, yellow, very soluble in ether; this substance he named rottlerin, C11H10O3. Botanical Description.—A tree, 6–8 meters high, covered with stellate groups of short yellow hairs. Leaves alternate, petiolate, rhomboid-oval or lanceolate, acuminate, 3-nerved, entire or slightly dentate, upper surface glabrous, lower surface covered with woolly hairs and powdery red glands. Flowers yellowish-green, small, diœcious, apetalous, in spikes. Staminate: By 3′s in the axil of each bract; perianth, 3 or 5 deeply cut, lanceolate lobules; stamens 15–25, free, inserted in the center of the flower. Pistillate: In the axil of each bract; ovary, 3 locules each with 1 ovule, covered like the leaves with hairs and yellow, granular glands. Seed vessel globose, 3-celled, like ovary covered with hairs and glands. Habitat.—Mountains of Morong, San Mateo, Tarlak, Bosoboso, Ilocos Norte, Albay and Batangas. Ricinus communis, L. (Variety microcarpus, Müll.) Nom. Vulg.—Tag̃antag̃an, Lig̃asina, Tag.; Tag̃antag̃an, Tawatawasig̃a, Iloc.; Castor Oil Plant, Eng. Uses.—A purgative oil is expressed from the seeds, called “Aceite de Ricino” (castor oil). It operates mechanically in the intestinal tract and its action is rapid and is indicated whenever it is desired simply to empty the intestines without producing any irritating effect; it is, therefore, a purgative indicated in diseases of children, in pregnancy, and in hemorrhoidal congestions where a non-irritating evacuation of the rectum is desired. It is an anthelmintic, though not ordinarily given alone, but in combination with other drugs of a purely anthelmintic action, the object being to expel the worms which have been attacked by the specific. Oil extracted simply by expression is less purgative than that obtained by treating the seeds with bisulphide of carbon and absolute alcohol; also less purgative than the seeds themselves, because it contains only a very small proportion of a drastic principle existing exclusively in the seeds; this principle is completely dissolved in the oil extracted by chemical process. It is pale yellow in color, very viscid, with a characteristic mouldy odor. The purgative dose is 10–30 grams. A small dose may purge as actively as a larger one provided that the patient drink abundantly after the administration of the drug. The best method of disguising its taste is by giving it in half a cup of very strong, hot coffee. Just before the dose, take a swallow of coffee to disguise the taste even more effectually. Castor oil enters into the composition of elastic collodion (simple collodion, 30 grams, castor oil, 2 grams). The leaves pounded and boiled are applied as a poultice to foul ulcers. Botanical Description.—There are two forms of this variety in the Philippines, possessing the same properties and known by the same common name: R. viridis, Müll. (R. communis, Blanco) and R. subpurpurascens, Müll.; the former is the more common and has a glabrous, fistular stem. Leaves peltate, palmately cleft in 7 or 9 lobules, lanceolate, serrate. Petioles long. Flowers greenish, monœcious, the staminate ones in large panicled clusters below the pistillate. Filaments numerous, subdivided into several anther-bearing branches. Pistillate flowers, 3 sepals, 3 styles. Seed vessel, 3 prickly capsules, containing solitary seeds. The R. subpurpurascens is distinguished from the former by bearing 2 glandules at the base of the leaves, the mulberry color of which latter suggests its common name, Tag̃antag̃an na morado, Tag., Vis. Habitat.—Very common in Luzon, Mindanao and other islands. Urticaceæ. Nettle Family. Artocarpus integrifolia, Willd. Nom. Vulg.—Nag̃ka, Tag.; Jack Fruit Tree, Eng. Uses.—The huge fruit of this tree is well known to the Filipinos and well liked by them as an article of food, eaten fresh or in sweet preserves. The arils and pulpy envelopes of the seeds are the parts eaten, also the seeds themselves, boiled or roasted. According to Padre Mercado the roasted seeds have an aphrodisiac action. The heated and powdered leaves are applied to wounds and given internally for congestions. The resin of the trunk is a useful application to ulcers and in India they give it internally to cure la melena, the dose, one “tola” mixed with the same amount of manga resin and a little lime water. The same resin if heated makes an excellent cement for broken china. Botanical Description.—A tree, 20° or more in height, with abundant milky sap. Leaves alternate, oval, acute at both ends, slightly wavy and revolute borders, tough, glabrous and dark green upper surface; light green, slightly rough under surface. Petioles short. Flowers greenish, monœcious, growing on root, trunk and branches. Calyx very small, monophyllous, of about 7 deciduous lobules. Staminate: On a club-shaped receptacle, 3′ or 4′ long, bristling with the stamens; filaments very short, anthers 2-celled. Pistillate: On a common, oblong receptacle which ripens to the great fruit; style 1, short; rarely 2 divergent styles; stigmas acute. Fruit about size and shape of a small watermelon, beset with many sharp eminences, containing many seeds enveloped in thick arils. Habitat.—It grows in all parts of the Archipelago and is commonly known. Laportea gaudichaudiana, Wedd. (Urtica umbellata, U. ferox, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Lig̃aton, Lipa, Apariagua (?), Tag., Vis.; Lipag̃doton, Pam. Uses.—The Padre Mercado writes as follows concerning the properties of this plant: “The leaves, applied with salt in the form of a plaster, purify dog bites, foul, putrid, malignant and cankerous ulcers; they cure boils, contusions and all abscesses; mixed with wax they may be applied for obstruction of the spleen; mashed with the juice and inserted in the nose they arrest nose-bleed; cooked with snails they soften the stomach, excite the secretion of urine and dissipate flatus; the juice given as a gargle aborts inflammation of the epiglottis. The seeds mixed with wine are a sexual excitant and “clear out” the womb; taken with syrup they relieve dyspnœa, pain in the side and inflammation of the lungs and force up the humors from the chest; it may be mixed with medicines that corrupt the flesh (sic). The grated root drunk with wine relieves painful flatulence. I myself (continues the Padre Mercado) have experimented with a woman who suffered with painful flatulence and this remedy relieved her.” We repeat that all the foregoing is copied from the writings of Padre Mercado and we offer it as a therapeutic curiosity. P. Blanco states that merely to touch the leaves causes an intolerable itching. Botanical Description.—A small tree, 12–15° high, trunk richly branched. Leaves opposite, bunched at the ends of the branches, notched at the base, long, ovate, serrate, hairy on both surfaces. Flowers yellowish-white, diœcious. Staminate: In compound racemes; calyx 4 parts; corolla none; stamens 4, inserted on the base of the calyx. Pistillate: Flowers in 2-forked umbel, flat, very large; calyx, none; stamens none; stigma 1; seed heart-shaped. Habitat.—Very common in all the fields and in the mountains. Blooms in June. Casuarineæ. Beefwood Family. Casuarina Sumatrana, Jung. (C. equisetifolia, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Agoho, Tag.; Malabohok, Agoho, Vis.; Aro, Karo, Agoó, Iloc. Uses.—The bark is astringent by virtue of the large quantity of tannin it contains. Its principal use is in decoction in the treatment of diarrhœa, dysentery and hæmoptysis; it is also given in amenorrhœa, though it is apt to increase the pain. Externally it is used as a wash for contusions and ulcers. Another species, C. equisetifolia, Forst., confounded with the former species by the natives, has the same therapeutic applications. Botanical Description.—A tree with stellately arranged straight branches. Leaves stellate, long, narrow, linear, 4-grooved. They have been compared to the tail of a horse and the tail of a certain bird—the casobar. Staminate and pistillate flowers greenish, on different parts of the same stalk. Staminate, in small aments. Pistillate on small globose aments; calyx proper of the floweret, a coarse scale; corolla none; ovary conical; styles 2, flattened, divergent; stigmas acute. Fruit: Each floweret produces a woody seed-vessel, bivalved, ovate, glabrous, with a small seed ending in an oval wing; all these seed vessels joined form a small cone about 1′ long. Habitat.—Very common in Ilocos, Tarlak, Binangonang of Lampong and N. Ecija. 1 Do not grow in the Philippines. 2 Waring, loc. cit., p. 170. 3 Journal de Pharmacie, Vol. XIV., p. 441. 4 L’Union Pharm., Vol. XXIII., p. 291. ');

Plátano, Sp.; Sagig̃, Tag., etc.; Banana, Eng. Uses.—The fruit produced by the various varieties of the banana plant constitutes one of the most wholesome and delicious of foods, appreciated by natives and Europeans alike. According to Boussingaul its nutritive value is greater than that of the potato and it may be used constantly without ill effects. Bananas contain a large percentage of sugar and mucilage. In India they dry them in the sun, as figs and grapes are treated in other countries and thus preserve them for long voyages by sea or land; eaten in conjunction with animal food they are a strong preventive of scurvy. If eaten when thoroughly ripe they have a laxative effect. The young and tender leaves are used in the Philippines as a protective dressing for ulcers, dermatitis, burns and cantharidal or other artificial blisters. Before applying to the affected surface the leaf is heated to make it more flexible and coated with a thin layer of cocoanut oil or other fatty substance. In the dispensaries of India they also use the leaves in this way, thus protecting and at the same time maintaining the moisture of the part. Dr. Waring recommends the practice and Dr. Van Someren follows it in the application of water dressings, having substituted banana leaves for gutta-percha. In Mauritius the fruit is used for dysentery, and the flowers, together with an equal quantity of those of Spilanthes Acmella, are made into a decoction and prescribed for dropsy. Botanical Description.—The banana plant with its huge waving leaves and succulent stem is universally familiar. The flower stalk rises through the center developing a drooping spike, the flowers in short rows in the axils of its large purplish bracts. According to Blanco there are 57 varieties of this plant in the Philippines, the following being the most common edible varieties: bug̃ulag̃, lakatan, letondag̃, obispo, higo, morado, butuan, bentikohol, sabá, tampuhig̃. Habitat.—Common everywhere in the islands. Zingiberaceæ. Ginger Family. Zingiber officinale, L. (Amomum zingiber, L. and Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Ajengibre, Jengibre, Sp.; Luya, Tag.; Laya, Bic.; Ginger, Eng. Uses.—The rhizome is used principally as a condiment in the Philippines. Its flavor is extremely agreeable, much appreciated in Europe by the English who are the greatest consumers of the condiment. In the Philippines a decoction is made of ginger and brown sugar, called tahu by the Chinese who drink it regularly as we do coffee in the early hours of the morning. It is an excellent drink, aromatic, tonic, stomachic and stimulant, and would probably be highly useful as well as economical as a part of the ration of European and native troops in the field. Hot tahú or tahu is an active diuretic; and during the last epidemic of cholera in Manila some physicians used it with very satisfactory results. Ginger is a good carminative and is official in the pharmacopœias of Europe, America and India. It is used with good effect in flatulent colic, atonic diseases of the intestines so common in the Philippines and in chronic rheumatism. The tincture is given in doses of 2–4 grams. The official infusion 30–60 grams. The rhizome contains a volatile oil1 (25 per cent.), a pale yellow liquid, specific gravity 0.878, the odor like that of the rhizome but lacking its strong and piquant taste. Its reaction is not acid; it dissolves slowly in alcohol. The burning taste is due to a resin that produces protocatechuic acid when melted with potassa. Botanical Description.—The only part employed is the rhizome, well known all over the islands and found in all their pharmacies and shops. Several stems rise 2–3° directly from the peculiar, branched rhizome; long-lanceolate, acuminate, entire, glabrous, alternate leaves diverge stiffly from the sides of the stem; petiole proper very short, its broader extension ensheathing the stem; general appearance of a single stem is much like that of the Solomon’s seal so familiar in the U. S. Curcuma longa, L. Nom. Vulg.—Dilaw, Tag.; Dulaw, Kalawaga, Kinamboy, Vis.; Ag̃ay, Pam.; Turmeric Plant, Eng. Uses.—The yellow rhizome called by some azafrán (saffron), is used as a condiment; its odor is remotely suggestive of vanilla. The Philippine herb-doctors give it internally for hæmoptysis, externally as a plaster or in infusion for acute dermatitis. The juice is prescribed in doses of 30–60 grams in bronchial catarrh. In India they inhale the fumes of burning turmeric paper for coryza, and with good effect according to the testimony of Dr. Waring. The drug is official in the Pharmacopœia of India. It is carminative, stimulant and probably antiseptic. Its decoction is used as an eye-wash in catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis. The Mohammedans of Deccan use it for jaundice upon the theory that the yellow color of the skin in that disease is an indication for a remedy of the same color. The juice is also used in many parts of India to stain the face, nails and other parts of the body. The tincture is prepared by macerating 30 grams of bruised rhizome in 200 cc. alcohol for seven days, then filtering. Turmeric paper is prepared by impregnating unsized paper with this tincture, and then drying. Both tincture and paper are used to test for alkalies. The rhizomes contain a pigment called curcumin, an essential oil and fæcula. Curcumin (C14H14O4) is crystalline, yellow by direct light and blue by reflected light; it was studied by Jackson and Menke. In the Philippines it is used extensively as a diaphoretic and emmenagogue and in icterus, intestinal colic and dysmenorrhœa; externally for skin diseases, contusions and atonic ulcers. Gubler regards it as a diffusible stimulant. Its use is more extensive in England than in France and Spain; in India it forms an ingredient of curry, called carí in Manila. Curcumin is eliminated by the urine, which it colors yellow, and if at the same time an alkali be taken by the patient, especially a salt of calcium, the urine becomes red and may communicate this stain to the clothes. This fact should be borne in mind to avoid embarrassing mistakes in diagnosis or prognosis. Dose of powder, 2–5 grams. Botanical Description.—Leaves 2–4° long, rising in bush-like bunches directly from the rhizome, broad-lanceolate, acuminate, gradually tapering down the long petioles; numerous prominent nerves give a ribbed appearance to the blade. Rhizome cylindrical, irregular, bright yellow within. Elettaria Cardamomum, White. Nom. Vulg.—Lag̃kuas, Lag̃kawas, Vis.; Cardamon, Eng. Uses.—This plant, though official in several pharmacopœias, is not used as a medicine in the Philippines, probably on account of its scarcity here. The seeds are used as a condiment; they are stimulant and carminative and yield good results in atonic dyspepsia, nervous depression and spasmodic or flatulent affections of the intestine. The dose of the powdered seeds is from 0.60–1.50 grams in pill form; the tincture is, however, more convenient and is given in doses of from 4 to 8 grams. Botanical Description.—A plant with a scaly rhizome and adventitious roots from which spring the stems, some of which bear leaves and others flowers. The leaves are alternate, in pairs; extended, lanceolate blade, with a short petiole. Branches bearing flowers, short, flexible and scaly. The flowers spring from the sheaths of the leaves. Calyx tubular, 3-toothed; second calyx with limb divided into 3 unequal lobules. Stamens 3. Ovary inferior, 3 many-ovuled compartments. Style simple. Stigma rounded. Fruit an oblong, ovoid capsule, 3-celled, trivalvate. Seeds blackish, albuminous. Habitat.—Visayan Islands. Amaryllidaceæ. Amaryllis Family. Crinum Asiaticum, L. (C. giganteum, Blanco.) Nom. Vulg.—Bakog̃, Tag. Uses.—The decoction of the leaves is used in the Philippines as an expectorant. The plant is official in the Pharmacopœia of India as an emetic and in small doses is nauseant and diaphoretic. As an emetic the dose of the fresh juice of the root is 8–16 grams every 10 minutes till vomiting occurs. Dr. W. O’Shaughnessy, writing from Bengal, states that this is the only indigenous and abundant emetic plant of which he has experience, which acts without producing griping, purging, or other unpleasant symptoms. In a communication to Dr. Waring he remarks that it is a good emetic and diaphoretic whenever ipecacuanha is not at hand but that it should be regarded not so much as a substitute for that article as a resource in case of need. The leaf juice is used in India to drop into the ears for disease of these organs. One of the infinite remedies used by the Filipinos under the name of “contrapoisons,” without specifying or knowing what poison, is the powdered root of Crinum, given internally with a little water. They also use the leaves locally for the itch, bruising them and rubbing the affected parts energetically with them. I may note here in passing, what I have written before: that the Filipinos have from time immemorial been familiar with the sarcopt of scabies (Kahaw) which they pick out with a needle or spine of some fish or vegetable. Botanical Description.—A plant with globose, scaly root. Leaves keeled or ridged. Flowers white, on a flattened stalk, on a spathe of 2 leaflets and several dry threads enclosing 4 flowerets. Corolla funnel-form, tube long and triangular; limb cut in 6 horizontal lanceolate lobes. Stamens 6, shorter than corolla. Anthers long. Stigma with 3 points. Seed vessel inferior, 3-celled, each cell containing a seed. Habitat.—Very common on the seashore and in groves of mangrove trees. Blooms in July. Liliaceæ. Lily Family. Aloes Barbadensis, Mill. (A. humilis, Blanco; A. vera, L.; A. vulgaris, Banck.; A. Indica, Royl.) Nom. Vulg.—Sabila, Tag.; Dilag̃ boaya, Vis.; Aloes, Eng. Uses.—This species is one of those which produce the substance known in pharmacy as aloes, which is the juice of the leaf evaporated to the consistency of an extract. It is official in all pharmacopoeias and its properties are known to the Filipino herb-doctors. They use the fresh juice of the leaves as a stimulant of the scalp in baldness and locally in contusions. Aloes is a slow purgative and its irritating action on the lower portion of the large intestine extends to the genito-urinary organs. It is, therefore, an emmenagogue and its prolonged use causes hemorrhoids, especially in man. It is contraindicated where there is disease of the genito-urinary organs or rectum. As it increases the secretion of bile it is useful in certain hepatic diseases. It is used in small doses as a tonic in dyspepsia. The tonic dose is ½–20 centigrams; purgative, 15–50 of the extract, preferably in pill form. It is customary to associate it with other purgatives. Botanical Description.—A stemless plant, the leaves springing immediately from the root as in the pineapple, joined at the base, straight, ligulate, very fleshy and becoming thinner toward the end, with stiff thorns along the edges. Flowers between yellow and red outside and straw-colored inside, in racemes on a cylindrical scape 3° or more high, sometimes ramose, peduncles very short. Corolla cylindrical, somewhat incurved, cleft to the middle in 6 parts, 3 external, acute and superposed on the others, obtuse at the apex and of different color. Stamens 6, inserted at the nectiferous base of the ovary and of the same length as the corolla. Anthers erect. Ovary cylindrical with 6 furrows. Stigma obtuse, with raveled edges. The seed vessel ovoid, 3-valved, 3-celled, with 2 seeds in each, furnished with 3 spongy wings. Habitat.—Common in gardens. Allium sativum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Ajo, Sp.; Bawag̃, Tag.; Garlic, Eng. Allium Cepa, L. Nom. Vulg.—Cebolla, Sp.; Lasuna, Sibuyas, Tag.; Onion, Eng. Uses.—The garlic and the onion are used to excess as condiments in Philippine as well as Spanish cooking. Both are difficult of digestion and communicate a very disagreeable odor to the breath, intolerable to those who are unaccustomed to it. Garlic possesses the singular property, familiar to many students and soldiers, of inducing a transient fever if introduced within the anus. When bruised and applied to the skin it has a counter-irritant action which makes it useful in the treatment of rheumatism, but the odor is so disagreeable that it is not worth while to use it for that purpose when we have so many other medicines which produce the same effect without being objectionable. It is also used locally for the bites of venomous animals. The onion is used cooked as a poultice over the bladder and internally for various catarrhs. It is better to abstain from the therapeutic and culinary use of products so indigestible and so malodorous. Botanical Description.—These plants are so well known in all parts of the world that a description of them would be superfluous. Palmæ. Palm Family. Areca Catechu, L. Nom. Vulg.—Bog̃a, Tag.; Betel-nut Palm, Areca, Eng. Uses.—The seeds form part of a masticatory very common throughout the extreme Orient, known as Buyo and composed of a betel leaf, a little slaked lime, and a slice of the fruit of the bonga, known as Siri in Indo-China and among the Malays. It is so common that it is hard to find a man or woman who does not use it. The saliva of those who use it is red and of a strong odor, and its careless use in time blackens the teeth and makes the breath extremely disagreeable. Habitual chewers consider it a tonic of the mouth and stomach and a general stimulant as well. It probably does possess these properties but they are reversed in the case of persons who use it immoderately for they lose appetite, become salivated, and the whole organism degenerates. The carbonized and powdered fruit is used as a dentifrice but its virtues are doubtless identical with those of any vegetable charcoal, i. e., absorbent and antiseptic. One unaccustomed to the use of bonga and chewing it for the first time, usually experiences a most disagreeable combination of symptoms; constriction of the œsophagus, a sensation of heat in the head and face, the latter becoming red and congested; at the same time dizziness and precordial distress are experienced. The same phenomena occur in certain persons after eating palmito salad or the tender central portion of the bonga and of other palms. The flowers are eaten in salad like the above-mentioned palmito. The seed is astringent and tænifuge; for the latter purpose it is given internally as a powder in a dose of from 16 to 24 grams. Its action is uncertain. The catechu which is obtained in India from the Bonga differs from that obtained from the Acacia Catechu and is a tonic analogous to rhatany and cinchona. The seeds contain about 14% of a fatty crystalline material which melts at 39°, and after saponification yields a crystalline, fatty acid that may be regarded as a mixture of lauric and muriatic acids. They also contain about 14% of a red, amorphous tonic material which, after drying, is but slightly soluble in cold or hot water. The lower part of the petiole of the leaves is thin and broad, ensheathing the trunk, is as tough as pasteboard when dry and is used in the Philippines as wrapping paper; Dr. Bholanauth Bose and other physicians of India use it as a material for splints in fractures, a practice which might well be imitated in Manila and especially in the country. Botanical Description.—A well-known palm with slender stem, surrounded by many circles; it grows to about the same height as the coco-nut palm or less. The flowers spring in bunches of long, thread-like spikes from the trunk a little below the crown of leaves at the base of the long, smooth, green, sheath-like petioles which clasp the trunk; each spike bears many staminate and a few pistillate flowers. The fruit is about the size and shape of a hen’s egg, the husk tow-like or filamentose, the kernel pinkish or light red. Habitat.—Grows throughout the islands. Cocos nucifera, L. Nom. Vulg.—Coco, Sp.-Fil.; Niog, Tag.; Coco-nut Palm, Eng. Uses.—This plant is, perhaps, the most useful in the Philippines. Without it and the bamboo plant the people of the Archipelago would not know how to live. It produces vinegar, an alcoholic drink called tuba or coco-wine, an oil, an edible nut, and its leaves are used instead of nipa to roof the huts. Tuba is an opaline, slightly sweet liquid, with an agreeable taste, which rapidly becomes acid under the influence of the heat. A flowering or fruit-bearing stalk, which has not been incised before, is chosen and encircled with several rings of rope or rattan. The stalk is then cut and a bamboo vessel called a bombón is hung to receive the sap which escapes during the night. This liquid is valuable as a drink for those who are debilitated, suffering from pulmonary catarrh, and even for consumptives, who are accustomed to drink it every morning, sometimes with marvelous results, according to reports. The heat of the day rapidly ferments the tuba, converting it into a mild vinegar, which is widely used for domestic purposes in the Philippines. When fermented and distilled it produces a weak alcohol of disagreeable taste called coco-wine. The ripe fruit contains a rather soft and savory meat which is generally eaten mixed with the clear, sweet coco-nut milk. Later the meat becomes firmer and is used as a food and an oil much used in the islands is extracted from it. To extract the oil the meat is grated and pressed until all the juice is extracted. This is called the milk and when boiled is converted almost completely into oil. Cocoanut milk has an agreeable taste and may in some cases take the place of cow’s milk. It is apt to produce diarrhœa, however, which action may be bad for some but on the other hand good for others, such as the habitually constipated. Both the meat and the milk are widely used by the natives in making sweets. In the greater part of the islands it is the only oil used for illumination. As a medicine it is employed internally as a purgative and externally in the treatment of scores of troubles in which the good results obtained are due, not to the oil but to the massage used in rubbing it in. It has the reputation of stimulating the growth of the hair and all the natives and some Europeans use it lavishly as a hair ointment. When fresh its odor is agreeable, but it easily becomes rancid and assumes a most disagreeable odor. In the Visayan Islands they make an oil of a nauseous odor which they call in Manila Caracoa. It is used only for illumination and by the poor. At a temperature of 20° or more the oil remains liquid; it is colorless when fresh and properly extracted. It solidifies at 18° and two kinds of soap are made of it; one soft and exceedingly cheap called “Quiapo”; the other hard, white, of a high quality, but as a rule containing an excess of lime which in time is deposited in a fluorescent film on its surface. In India the root is employed in the treatment of dysentery. Botanical Description.—A tree most familiar to every one. Habitat.—Common in all parts of the Archipelago. Nipa fruticans, Wurmb. Nom. Vulg.—Nipa, Sp.-Fil.; Sasa, Tag. Uses.—The dry leaves of this palm are generally used in the villages of Manila Province, Pampanga, Bulacan and other provinces in the construction of roofs and walls of houses, which are therefore called “nipa houses.” The decoction of the fresh leaves is used as a lotion for indolent ulcers, and a popular preserve is made from the fruit. Like the coco and following the same process the nipa yields a liquid also called tuba and possessing properties identical with those of the former plant. The weak alcohol distilled from it has some repute in the treatment of conjunctivitis, for which purpose a few drops are mixed with a small quantity of water and the eyes are washed with it several times a day. This alcohol, improperly called wine of nipa, has a characteristically unpleasant odor which makes it impracticable for medicinal or industrial use. Several chemists have attempted to remove the characteristic odor from nipa alcohol, but their results had always been negative because the odorous principle was distilled over at the same temperature as the alcohol. Finally a distinguished Filipino chemist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, perfected a process of producing from the nipa tuba an absolute alcohol perfectly free from the characteristic odor; an alcohol, in fact, possessing all the qualities of chemically pure alcohol, and of such a high grade that it was awarded the first prize at the last World’s Fair in Paris. Botanical Description.—A palm about 6° high with long, pinnate leaves with leaflets which separate, at maturity, like those of the coco palm. Flowers monœcious, in a spathe. Fruit, many pyramidal drupes joined together, but easily separable. The outer covering of each drupe is hard, the inner part tow-like; seed enveloped in a sort of fleshy white meat. Habitat.—Salt water marshes, especially in Pampanga and the Visayan Islands. Cyperaceæ. Sedge Family. Cyperus rotundus, L. Nom. Vulg.—Mutha, Tag.; Botobotones, Vis.; Mota, Malaapolid, Sursur, Onoran, Kusug̃, Omadiug̃, Galonalpas, Pam.; Nutgrass or Coco-grass, Eng. Uses.—The root possesses stimulant, diaphoretic, diuretic and emmenagogue properties. In the Philippines it is used internally for dysentery, and in India for the same purpose and as a vermifuge. It is given as a tonic in gastro-intestinal diseases, and General Hardwick has reported good results with it in cholera; as he reported only two cases, his testimony is not of much value. The Chinese use the dry or roasted root, especially in inflammation of the viscera and uterine diseases. They also attribute to it diuretic, emmenagogue and anthelmintic properties. In Java and India they use it for gonorrhœa, and in Mauritius as a diaphoretic and astringent. In the Philippines the bruised root is applied to the face for toothache. Botanical Description.—The root is ovoid, ranging in size from that of a hazel-nut to that of a walnut, composed of a white, spongy substance. Leaves sword-shaped, ensheathing the stem. Flowers in a compound umbel on the end of the stalk which is naked, long and triangular. The umbellets are alternate, awl-shaped, with distinct flowers. Calyx universal, with 2 sword-shaped leaflets. Calyx proper, a very small, ridged scale. Corolla none. Stamens 3. Filaments long, inserted on the base of the ovary. Anthers long and straight. Style 1. Stigmas 3, simple, revolute. Fruit 1. Seed oblong, 3-sided, glabrous. Habitat.—Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in June and July. Gramineæ. Grass Family. Zea Mays, L. Nom. Vulg.—Maíz, Sp.; Maize, Corn, Eng. Uses.—Corn is an extensive article of diet in the Philippines, but has the reputation of being indigestible. This is true when it is eaten in the grain, but in the form of meal it is easily digested and highly nutritious. The tassels have been used in the Philippines from time immemorial in decoction as a diuretic, for which property they received notice in the Medical World of Paris about the year 1876. The entire plant is diuretic and the natives give the decoction of the stalk for various diseases of the bladder and kidneys. An extract of the tassels has been put on the market, but it is better to administer a decoction made from 20 grams of tassel to 1 liter of water to be taken at will during the day. Rademaker and Fischer give the following chemical composition: Fixed oil 5.25 Resin, crystalline matter and chlorophyl 3.25 Maizenic acid 2.25 Sugar and gum 19.50 Albuminoids 3.50 Salts and extracts 5.50 Cellulose 37.00 Water 20.00 The fixed oil is bright yellow, saponifiable by potash, soluble in chloroform and ether, insoluble in alcohol, solidifies at 10°. Habitat.—Very common in all parts of the islands. Andropogon Schoenanthes, L. Nom. Vulg.—Salay, Tag̃lad, Tag.; Paja de Meca, Sp.-Fil.; Baliyoko, Vis.; Geranium Grass, Eng. Uses.—The Filipino women use the leaves to perfume their gogo hair-wash. The decoction of the leaves is used internally as a diuretic (10 grams to a liter of water) and also to bathe pregnant women. The roots also are diuretic. A Manila pharmacist, D. Rosendo García, has obtained a good quality of the fixed oil of this plant. In India they call this essence rusa, geranium and gin-gembre (nimar oil, Eng.); the annual export from Bombay is over 40,000 English pounds. It is dextrogyrous and its formula is C5H4. Another species, the A. nardus, L., commonly called “raiz de mora” (mulberry root), “citronella,” Eng., possesses the same therapeutic properties as the former. It also possesses an agreeable perfume and yields an essential oil, which, like rusa, is used to adulterate Attar of Roses. The dried root is widely used in the Philippines and in Europe as well, to preserve clothing from moths and other destructive insects, at the same time giving them a sweet odor. In India the decoction is used internally, 10 grams to a liter of water, in the treatment of rheumatism and as a diuretic. Botanical Description.—An indigenous grass with sword-shaped leaves about 4° high, tapering at the base, possessing a sweet odor. Root thick, irregular, rough, formed by the union of several small rootlets. Saccharum officinarum, L. Nom. Vulg.—Cañamiel, Caña de azúcar, Caña dulc, Sp.; Tubo, Tag.; Sugar Cane, Eng. Uses.—The Filipinos are very fond of the fresh cane. The juice, which is extracted by means of primitive wooden presses, is used as a drink mixed with lemon juice or vino and is sold in markets and public places as a popular beverage on hot days. A tepid juice, extracted from heated cane is given for catarrhal troubles. This use of the juice is the only one peculiar to the Philippines. Its general use and properties are universally familiar and are amply treated in the materia medica. Botanical Description.—This plant is so universally familiar that it is unnecessary to describe it. More than 20 varieties are found in the Philippines. Habitat.—Throughout the islands, especially in the Island of Negros and the Luzon Provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija. Oriza, L. Nom. Vulg.—Arroz, Sp.; Palay, Tag. (the plant and the unhusked rice); Bigas, Tag. (the husked rice); Rice, Eng. Uses.—All the people of Indo-China, China, Japan and the greater part of the Indian Archipelago eat rice as Europeans do bread. In the Philippines an immense variety of rice grows and in the World’s Fair at Paris, in 1889, Señor D. Regino García, of Manila, presented a unique collection of 147 varieties. The rice grown in high lands above irrigation is called “arroz de secano” and mountain rice, and that grown in low and irrigated land is called “arroz de sementera” and swamp rice. The two kinds are equally valuable as food. The proportion of starch in rice is large, but it contains but a small amount of gluten, and therefore a large amount must be eaten in order to obtain sufficient nutritive elements. Water 5.00 Starch 85.07 Parenchyma 4.80 Nitrogenous matter 3.68 Crystallizable sugar 0.29 Gummy matter 1.71 Oil 0.13 Phosphate of lime 0.40 Chloride of potash, phosphate of potash, acetic acid, calcareous vegetable salt, salt of potash, sulphur Traces. In the Filipino therapeutics rice has an extensive use, especially in the form of a decoction called cange, which is commonly given in the treatment of diarrhœa and dysentery, with good results. Cooked as a sort of mush it may be used as a substitute for linseed poultices and has the great advantage of not becoming rancid. Roasted and powdered it is dusted upon wounds or abrasions of the skin and forms a dry and absorbent covering under which they heal rapidly. It has lately been claimed that beriberi is due to a microorganism found in rice under certain abnormal conditions; this claim is not yet firmly established and beriberi is still one of the many problems in medicine which are awaiting solution. Habitat.—All parts of the Archipelago. Bambuseæ. Bamboo Family. Nom. Vulg.—Caña, Sp.; Bamboo, Eng. Linnæus and Blanco include in the genus Bambus all the different species of bamboo to which the Spaniards have given the general name of caña. The plant is of incomparable value to the natives of the Philippines; they build their houses of it, make agricultural and industrial instruments of it, use it in all the varied apparatus of their fisheries and for a multitude of household utensils and furniture. The variety B. arundinacea, Retz. (B. arundo, Blanco), Kawayag-totóo, Tag., is the largest and most generally employed in making houses and furniture. The tender shoots prepared in lime water are edible but have the deserved reputation of being difficult of digestion. The variety Schizostachyum acutiflorum, Munro (B. diffusa, Blanco), Osiw, Bokawy, Tag., is less used. The shoots are used to treat opacity of the cornea, for which purpose they are cut when about a palm in height, the outer leaves removed, and the center soaked over night with a little sugar candy. The following day the water in the bottom of the jar is collected and used to paint the cornea. The variety Dendrocalamus sericens, Munro (B. mitis, Blanco), Taywanak, Tag., is also used in medicine. Its abundant sap is given internally in the treatment of phthisis. All of the above species and the Dendrocalamus flagellifer, Munro (B. levis, Blanco), Boho, Tag., produce at their joints a hard porcelain-like substance, friable, of opaline color, called “bamboo stone” or “tabashir” in India, where, as well as in the Philippines and Indo-China, it has great repute among the popular remedies. It is given in venereal diseases, hiccough, hemorrhage, fevers and other diseases. As a matter of fact, it is an almost inert substance, the imaginary virtues of which originated, doubtless, in the apparently remarkable fact that a stone (?) was produced inside of a vegetable. The analysis of M. Guibourt is as follows: Silicon 96.04 Water 2.94 Lime and potassium 0.13 Organic material Traces. 1 European analyses make the amount 1–2.2 per cent. ');

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

(20, 5, 'ch01', 3, ' Chapter IChapter ILucy Looks Into a WardrobeOnce there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air–raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office. He had no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs. Macready and three servants. (Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, but they do not come into the story much.) He himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair, which grew over most of his face as well as on his head, and they liked him almost at once; but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at the front door he was so odd–looking that Lucy (who was the youngest) was a little afraid of him, and Edmund (who was the next youngest) wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he was blowing his nose to hide it.As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night, the boys came into the girls\' room and they all talked it over.\"We\'ve fallen on our feet and no mistake,\" said Peter. \"This is going to be perfectly splendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like.\"\"I think he\'s an old dear,\" said Susan.\"Oh, come off it!\" said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be tired, which always made him bad–tempered. \"Don\'t go on talking like that.\"\"Like what?\" said Susan; \"and anyway, it\'s time you were in bed.\"\"Trying to talk like Mother,\" said Edmund. \"And who are you to say when I\'m to go to bed? Go to bed yourself.\"\"Hadn\'t we all better go to bed?\" said Lucy. \"There\'s sure to be a row if we\'re heard talking here.\"\"No there won\'t,\" said Peter. \"I tell you this is the sort of house where no one\'s going to mind what we do. Anyway, they won\'t hear us. It\'s about ten minutes\' walk from here down to that dining room, and any amount of stairs and passages in between.\"\"What\'s that noise?\" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy.\"It\'s only a bird, silly,\" said Edmund.\"It\'s an owl,\" said Peter. \"This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. I shall go to bed now. I say, let\'s go and explore to–morrow. You might find anything in a place like this. Did you see those mountains as we came along? And the woods? There might be eagles. There might be stags. There\'ll be hawks.\"\"Badgers!\" said Lucy.\"Snakes!\" said Edmund.\"Foxes!\" said Susan.But when next morning came, there was a steady rain falling, so thick that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden.\"Of course it would be raining!\" said Edmund. They had just finished breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them—a long, low room with two windows looking out in one direction and two in another.\"Do stop grumbling, Ed,\" said Susan. \"Ten to one it\'ll clear up in an hour or so. And in the meantime we\'re pretty well off. There\'s a wireless and lots of books.\"\"Not for me,\" said Peter, \"I\'m going to explore in the house.\"Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places. The first few doors they tried led only into spare bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would; but soon they came to a very long room full of pictures and there they found a suit of armour; and after that was a room all hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and then came three steps down and five steps up, and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a balcony, and then a whole series of rooms that led into each other and were lined with books—most of them very old books and some bigger than a Bible in a church. And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite empty except for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a looking–glass in the door. There was nothing else in the room at all except a dead blue–bottle on the window–sill.\"Nothing there!\" said Peter, and they all trooped out again—all except Lucy. She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe, even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked. To her surprise it opened quite easily, and two moth–balls dropped out.Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up—mostly long fur coats. There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed her face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe. Soon she went further in and found that there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe. She took a step further in—then two or three steps—always expecting to feel woodwork against the tips of her fingers. But she could not feel it.\"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\" thought Lucy, going still further in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet. \"I wonder is that more moth–balls?\" she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hands. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold, \"This is very queer,\" she said, and went on a step or two further.Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. \"Why, it is just like branches of trees!\" exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night–time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She looked back over her shoulder and there, between the dark tree–trunks, she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out. (She had, of course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.) It seemed to be still daylight there. \"I can always get back if anything goes wrong,\" thought Lucy. She began to walk forward, crunch–crunch, over the snow and through the wood towards the other light.In about ten minutes she reached it and found that it was a lamp–post. As she stood looking at it, wondering why there was a lamp–post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter patter of feet coming towards her. And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp–post.He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella, white with snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shaped like a goat\'s (the hair on them was glossy black) and instead of feet he had goat\'s hoofs. He also had a tail, but Lucy did not notice this at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it from trailing in the snow. He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and his skin was rather reddish too. He had a strange, but pleasant little face with a short pointed beard and curly hair, and out of the hair there stuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead. One of his hands, as I have said, held the umbrella: in the other arm he carried several brown paper parcels. What with the parcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping. He was a Faun. And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcels.\"Goodness gracious me!\" exclaimed the Faun.'),
(21, 5, 'ch02', 4, ' Chapter IIChapter IIWhat Lucy Found There\"Good evening,\" said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up his parcels that at first he did not reply. When he had finished he made her a little bow.\"Good evening, good evening,\" said the Faun. \"Excuse me—I don\'t want to be inquisitive—but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?\"\"My name\'s Lucy,\" said she, not quite understanding him.\"But you are—forgive me—you are what they call a girl?\" asked the Faun.\"Of course I\'m a girl,\" said Lucy.\"You are in fact Human?\"\"Of course I\'m human,\" said Lucy, still a little puzzled.\"To be sure, to be sure,\" said the Faun. \"How stupid of me! But I\'ve never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted. That is to say—\" and then he stopped as if he had been going to say something he had not intended but had remembered in time. \"Delighted, delighted,\" he went on. \"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus.\"\"I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy.\"And may I ask, O Lucy, Daughter of Eve,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"how you have come into Narnia?\"\"Narnia? What\'s that?\" said Lucy.\"This is the land of Narnia,\" said the Faun, \"where we are now; all that lies between the lamp–post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you—you have come from the wild woods of the west?\"\"I—I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,\" said Lucy.\"Ah!\" said Mr. Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, \"if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange countries. It is too late now.\"\"But they aren\'t countries at all,\" said Lucy, almost laughing. \"It\'s only just back there—at least—I\'m not sure. It is summer there.\"\"Meanwhile,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow. Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and had tea with me?\"\"Thank you very much, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy. \"But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back.\"\"It\'s only just round the corner,\" said the Faun, \"and there\'ll be a roaring fire—and toast—and sardines—and cake.\"\"Well, it\'s very kind of you,\" said Lucy. \"But I shan\'t be able to stay long.\"\"If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us. That\'s the way. Now—off we go.\"And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they had known one another all their lives.They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr. Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave. As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire. Then Mr. Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. \"Now we shan\'t be long,\" he said, and immediately put a kettle on.Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs (\"one for me and one for a friend,\" said Mr. Tumnus) and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr. Tumnus\' bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of books. Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things. They had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men, Monks and Gamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?\"Now, Daughter of Eve!\" said the Faun.And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar–topped cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk–white Stag who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure–seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. \"Not that it isn\'t always winter now,\" he added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time. It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said,\"Oh Mr. Tumnus—I\'m so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune—but really, I must go home. I only meant to stay for a few minutes.\"\"It\'s no good now, you know,\" said the Faun, laying down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully.\"No good?\" said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. \"What do you mean? I\'ve got to go home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me.\" But a moment later she asked, \"Mr. Tumnus! Whatever is the matter?\" for the Faun\'s brown eyes had filled with tears and then the tears began trickling down his cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of his nose; and at last he covered his face with his hands and began to howl.\"Mr. Tumnus! Mr. Tumnus!\" said Lucy in great distress. \"Don\'t! Don\'t! What is the matter? Aren\'t you well? Dear Mr. Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong.\" But the Faun continued sobbing as if his heart would break. And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her handkerchief, he did not stop. He merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it, wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch.\"Mr. Tumnus!\" bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him. \"Do stop. Stop it at once! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you. What on earth are you crying about?\"\"Oh—oh—oh!\" sobbed Mr. Tumnus, \"I\'m crying because I\'m such a bad Faun.\"\"I don\'t think you\'re a bad Faun at all,\" said Lucy. \"I think you are a very good Faun. You are the nicest Faun I\'ve ever met.\"\"Oh—oh—you wouldn\'t say that if you knew,\" replied Mr. Tumnus between his sobs. \"No, I\'m a bad Faun. I don\'t suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world.\"\"But what have you done?\" asked Lucy.\"My old father, now,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"that\'s his picture over the mantelpiece. He would never have done a thing like this.\"\"A thing like what?\" said Lucy.\"Like what I\'ve done,\" said the Faun. \"Taken service under the White Witch. That\'s what I am. I\'m in the pay of the White Witch.\"\"The White Witch? Who is she?\"\"Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb. It\'s she that makes it always winter. Always winter and never Christmas; think of that!\"\"How awful!\" said Lucy. \"But what does she pay you for?\"\"That\'s the worst of it,\" said Mr. Tumnus with a deep groan. \"I\'m a kidnapper for her, that\'s what I am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would you believe that I\'m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood, one that had never done me any harm, and pretend to be friendly with it, and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch?\"\"No,\" said Lucy. \"I\'m sure you wouldn\'t do anything of the sort.\"\"But I have,\" said the Faun.\"Well,\" said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be truthful and yet not to be too hard on him), \"well, that was pretty bad. But you\'re so sorry for it that I\'m sure you will never do it again.\"\"Daughter of Eve, don\'t you understand?\" said the Faun. \"It isn\'t something I have done. I\'m doing it now, this very moment.\"\"What do you mean?\" cried Lucy, turning very white.\"You are the child,\" said Mr. Tumnus. \"I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch them and hand them over to her. And you are the first I ever met. And I\'ve pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea, and all the time I\'ve been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell her.\"\"Oh but you won\'t, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy. \"You won\'t, will you? Indeed, indeed you really mustn\'t.\"\"And if I don\'t,\" said he, beginning to cry again, \"she\'s sure to find out. And she\'ll have my tail cut off, and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she\'ll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse\'s. And if she is extra and specially angry she\'ll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled—and goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever happen at all.\"\"I\'m very sorry, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy. \"But please let me go home.\"\"Of course I will,\" said the Faun. \"Of course I\'ve got to. I see that now. I hadn\'t known what Humans were like before I met you. Of course I can\'t give you up to the Witch; not now that I know you. But we must be off at once. I\'ll see you back to the lamp–post. I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?\"\"I\'m sure I can,\" said Lucy.\"We must go as quietly as we can,\" said Mr. Tumnus. \"The whole wood is full of her spies. Even some of the trees are on her side.\"They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr. Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun\'s cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and Mr. Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp–post again.\"Do you know your way from here, Daughter of Eve?\" said Tumnus.Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I can see the wardrobe door.\"\"Then be off home as quick as you can,\" said the Faun, \"and—c–can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do?\"\"Why, of course I can,\" said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand. \"And I do hope you won\'t get into dreadful trouble on my account.\"\"Farewell, Daughter of Eve,\" said he. \"Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?\"\"Rather!\" said Lucy, and then ran towards the far–off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her. And presently instead of rough branches brushing past her she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden boards, and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started. She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around, panting for breath. It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage.\"I\'m here,\" she shouted. \"I\'m here. I\'ve come back, I\'m all right.\"');

(22, 5, 'ch03', 5, ' Chapter IIIChapter IIIEdmund and the WardrobeLucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three.\"It\'s all right,\" she repeated, \"I\'ve come back.\"\"What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?\" asked Susan.\"Why?\" said Lucy in amazement, \"haven\'t you all been wondering where I was?\"\"So you\'ve been hiding, have you?\" said Peter. \"Poor old Lu, hiding and nobody noticed! You\'ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you.\"\"But I\'ve been away for hours and hours,\" said Lucy.The others all stared at one another.\"Batty!\" said Edmund tapping his head. \"Quite batty.\"\"What do you mean, Lu?\" asked Peter.\"What I said,\" answered Lucy. \"It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe, and I\'ve been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and all sorts of things have happened.\"\"Don\'t be silly, Lucy,\" said Susan. \"We\'ve only just come out of that room a moment ago, and you were there then.\"\"She\'s not being silly at all,\" said Peter, \"she\'s just making up a story for fun, aren\'t you, Lu? And why shouldn\'t she?\"\"No, Peter, I\'m not,\" she said. \"It\'s—it\'s a magic wardrobe. There\'s a wood inside it, and it\'s snowing, and there\'s a Faun and a witch and it\'s called Narnia; come and see.\"The others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that they all went back with her into the room. She rushed ahead of them, flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried, \"Now! go in and see for yourselves.\"\"Why, you goose,\" said Susan, putting her head inside and pulling the fur coats apart, \"it\'s just an ordinary wardrobe, look! there\'s the back of it.\"Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; and they all saw—Lucy herself saw—a perfectly ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and no snow, only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it. Peter went in and rapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.\"A jolly good hoax, Lu,\" he said as he came out again, \"you have really taken us in, I must admit. We half believed you.\"\"But it wasn\'t a hoax at all,\" said Lucy, \"really and truly. It was all different a moment ago. Honestly it was. I promise.\"\"Come, Lu,\" said Peter, \"that\'s going a bit far. You\'ve had your joke. Hadn\'t you better drop it now?\"Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she hardly knew what she was trying to say, and burst into tears.For the next few days she was very miserable. She could have made it up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing was only a story made up for fun. But Lucy was a very truthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right; and she could not bring herself to say this. The others who thought she was telling a lie, and a silly lie too, made her very unhappy. The two elder ones did this without meaning to do it, but Edmund could be spiteful, and on this occasion he was spiteful. He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if she\'d found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the house. What made it worse was that these days ought to have been delightful. The weather was fine and they were out of doors from morning to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees, birds\' nesting, and lying in the heather. But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it. And so things went on until the next wet day.That day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a break in the weather, they decided to play hide–and–seek. Susan was \"It\" and as soon as the others scattered to hide, Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe was. She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she knew that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business. But she did want to have one more look inside it; for by this time she was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream. The house was so large and complicated and full of hiding places that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else. But as soon as she reached it she heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her. She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund; and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He at once decided to get into it himself—not because he thought it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country. He opened the door. There were the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell of mothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy. \"She thinks I\'m Susan come to catch her,\" said Edmund to himself, \"and so she\'s keeping very quiet in at the back.\" He jumped in and shut the door, forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do. Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark. He had expected to find her in a few seconds and was very surprised when he did not. He decided to open the door again and let in some light. But he could not find the door either. He didn\'t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction; he even shouted out. \"Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know you\'re here.\"There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound—not the sound you expect in a cupboard but a kind of open–air sound. He also noticed that he was unexpectedly cold; and then he saw a light.\"Thank goodness,\" said Edmund, \"the door must have swung open of its own accord.\" He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light which he thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees. Overhead there was a pale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter day in the morning. Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear. Everything was perfectly still, as if he were the only living creature in that country. There was not even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he could see in every direction. He shivered.He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy; and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her \"imaginary country\" which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all. He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted, \"Lucy! Lucy! I\'m here too—Edmund.\"There was no answer.\"She\'s angry about all the things I\'ve been saying lately,\" thought Edmund. And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong, he also did not much like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet place; so he shouted again.\"I say, Lu! I\'m sorry I didn\'t believe you. I see now you were right all along. Do come out. Make it Pax.\"Still there was no answer.\"Just like a girl,\" said Edmund to himself, \"sulking somewhere, and won\'t accept an apology.\" He looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place, and had almost made up his mind to go home, when he heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He listened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them; their branching horns were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrise caught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with bells. On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet high if he had been standing. He was dressed in polar bear\'s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point; his huge beard covered his knees and served him instead of a rug. But behind him, on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person—a great lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen. She also was covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head. Her face was white—not merely pale, but white like snow or paper or icing sugar, except for her very red mouth. It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold and stern.The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bells jingling and the Dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it.\"Stop!\" said the Lady, and the Dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down. Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bits and blowing. In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostrils looked like smoke.\"And what, pray, are you?\" said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.\"I\'m—I\'m—my name\'s Edmund,\" said Edmund rather awkwardly. He did not like the way she looked at him.The Lady frowned. \"Is that how you address a Queen?\" she asked, looking sterner than ever.\"I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn\'t know,\" said Edmund.\"Not know the Queen of Narnia?\" cried she. \"Ha! You shall know us better hereafter. But I repeat—what are you?\"\"Please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, \"I don\'t know what you mean. I\'m at school—at least I was—it\'s the holidays now.\"'),
(23, 5, 'ch04', 6, ' Chapter IVChapter IVTurkish Delight\"But what are you?\" said the Queen again. \"Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard.\"\"No, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, \"I never had a beard, I\'m a boy.\"\"A boy!\" said she. \"Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?\"Edmund stood still, saying nothing. He was too confused by this time to understand what the question meant.\"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be,\" said the Queen. \"Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?\"\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said Edmund.\"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?\"\"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe.\"\"A wardrobe? What do you mean?\"\"I—I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty,\" said Edmund.\"Ha!\" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. \"A door. A door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with.\" As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.\"My poor child,\" she said in quite a different voice, \"how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk.\"Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.\"Perhaps something hot to drink?\" said the Queen. \"Should you like that?\"\"Yes please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm, she let one drop fall from it on to the snow beside the sledge. Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid–air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed. The Dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a very nice smile. Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.\"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,\" said the Queen presently. \"What would you like best to eat?\"\"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund.The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one\'s mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming back to it. \"You are sure there are just four of you?\" she asked. \"Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?\" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, \"Yes, I told you that before,\" and forgetting to call her \"Your Majesty\" but she didn\'t seem to mind now.At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him any more. Instead, she said to him,\"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?\"\"I\'ll try,\" said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.\"Because, if you did come again—bringing them with you of course—I\'d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight. I can\'t do it now, the magic will only work once. In my own house it would be another matter.\"\"Why can\'t we go to your house now?\" said Edmund. When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back, but he had forgotten about that fear now.\"It is a lovely place, my house,\" said the Queen. \"I am sure you would like it. There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what\'s more, I have no children of my own. I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long; and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I\'ve ever met. I think I would like to make you the Prince—some day, when you bring the others to visit me.\"\"Why not now?\" said Edmund. His face had become very red and his mouth and fingers were sticky. He did not look either clever or handsome whatever the Queen might say.\"Oh, but if I took you there now,\" said she, \"I shouldn\'t see your brother and your sisters. I very much want to know your charming relations. You are to be the Prince and—later on—the King; that is understood. But you must have courtiers and nobles. I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters Duchesses.\"\"There\'s nothing special about them,\" said Edmund, \"and, anyway, I could always bring them some other time.\"\"Ah, but once you were in my house,\" said the Queen, \"you might forget all about them. You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn\'t want the bother of going to fetch them. No. You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you understand. It is no good coming without them.\"\"But I don\'t even know the way back to my own country,\" pleaded Edmund.\"That\'s easy,\" answered the Queen. \"Do you see that lamp?\" She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp–post under which Lucy had met the Faun. \"Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of Men. And now look the other way\"—here she pointed in the opposite direction—\"and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees.\"\"I think I can,\" said Edmund.\"Well my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you have only to find the lamp–post and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house. You had better keep the river on your right when you get to it. But remember—you must bring the others with you. I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone.\"\"I\'ll do my best,\" said Edmund.\"And, by the way,\" said the Queen, \"you needn\'t tell them about me. It would be fun to keep it a secret between us two, wouldn\'t it? Make it a surprise for them. Just bring them along to the two hills—a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that—and when you come to my house you could just say \'Let\'s see who lives here\' or something like that. I am sure that would be best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may have heard strange stories about me—nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me. Fauns will say anything, you know, and now—\"\"Please, please,\" said Edmund suddenly, \"please couldn\'t I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home?\"\"No, no,\" said the Queen with a laugh, \"you must wait till next time.\" While she spoke, she signalled to the Dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund calling out, \"Next time! Next time! Don\'t forget. Come soon.\"Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling his own name, and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood.\"Oh, Edmund!\" she cried. \"So you\'ve got in too! Isn\'t it wonderful, and now—\"\"All right,\" said Edmund, \"I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all. I\'ll say I\'m sorry if you like. But where on earth have you been all this time? I\'ve been looking for you everywhere.\"\"If I\'d known you had got in I\'d have waited for you,\" said Lucy who was too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face was. \"I\'ve been having lunch with dear Mr. Tumnus, the Faun, and he\'s very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting me go, so he thinks she can\'t have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all.\"\"The White Witch?\" said Edmund, \"who\'s she?\"\"She is a perfectly terrible person,\" said Lucy. \"She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and dwarfs and animals—at least all the good ones—simply hate her. And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things. And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia—always winter, but it never gets to Christmas. And she drives about on a sledge, drawn by a reindeer, with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head.\"Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets, and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.\"Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?\" he asked.\"Mr. Tumnus, the Faun,\" said Lucy.\"You can\'t always believe what Fauns say,\" said Edmund, trying to sound as if he knew far more about them than Lucy.\"Who said so?\" asked Lucy.\"Everyone knows it,\" said Edmund, \"ask anybody you like. But it\'s pretty poor sport standing here in the snow. Let\'s go home.\"\"Yes, let\'s,\" said Lucy. \"Oh Edmund, I am glad you\'ve got in too. The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there. What fun it will be.\"But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as for her. He would have to admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animals; but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He did not know what he would say, or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia.By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room.\"I say,\" said Lucy, \"you do look awful, Edmund. Don\'t you feel well?\"\"I\'m all right,\" said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very sick.\"Come on then,\" said Lucy, \"let\'s find the others. What a lot we shall have to tell them! And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we\'re all in it together.\"'),
(24, 5, 'ch05', 7, ' Chapter VChapter VBack on This Side of the DoorBecause the game of hide–and–seek was still going on, it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others. But when at last they were all together (which happened in the long room, where the suit of armour was) Lucy burst out,\"Peter! Susan! It\'s all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one another in there, in the wood. Go on, Edmund; tell them all about it.\"\"What\'s all this about, Ed?\" said Peter.And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but he hadn\'t made up his mind what to do. When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of. He decided to let Lucy down.\"Tell us, Ed,\" said Susan.And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy (there was really only a year\'s difference) and then a little snigger and said, \"Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing—pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true. Just for fun, of course. There\'s nothing there really.\"Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he had scored a great success, and went on at once to say, \"There she goes again. What\'s the matter with her? That\'s the worst of young kids, they always—\"\"Look here,\" said Peter turning on him savagely, \"shut up! You\'ve been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite.\"\"But it\'s all nonsense,\" said Edmund, very taken aback.\"Of course it\'s all nonsense,\" said Peter, \"that\'s just the point. Lu was perfectly all right when we left home, but since we\'ve been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar. But whichever it is, what good do you think you\'ll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next?\"\"I thought—I thought,\" said Edmund; but he couldn\'t think of anything to say.\"You didn\'t think anything at all,\" said Peter, \"it\'s just spite. You\'ve always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself; we\'ve seen that at school before now.\"\"Do stop it,\" said Susan; \"it won\'t make things any better having a row between you two. Let\'s go and find Lucy.\"It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyone could see that she had been crying. Nothing they could say to her made any difference. She stuck to her story and said:\"I don\'t care what you think, and I don\'t care what you say. You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I know I\'ve met a Faun in there and—I wish I\'d stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts.\"It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel that his plan wasn\'t working as well as he had expected. The two older ones were really beginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind. They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she had gone to bed.The result was that next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor. \"He\'ll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu,\" said Peter; \"it\'s getting beyond us.\" So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said \"Come in,\" and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal. Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fingers pressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the whole story. After that he said nothing for quite a long time. Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected.\"How do you know?\" he asked, \"that your sister\'s story is not true?\"\"Oh, but—\" began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man\'s face that he was perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself together and said, \"But Edmund said they had only been pretending.\"\"That is a point,\" said the Professor, \"which certainly deserves consideration; very careful consideration. For instance—if you will excuse me for asking the question—does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable? I mean, which is the more truthful?\"\"That\'s just the funny thing about it, Sir,\" said Peter. \"Up till now, I\'d have said Lucy every time.\"\"And what do you think, my dear?\" said the Professor, turning to Susan.\"Well,\" said Susan, \"in general, I\'d say the same as Peter, but this couldn\'t be true—all this about the wood and the Faun.\"\"That is more than I know,\" said the Professor, \"and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thing indeed.\"\"We were afraid it mightn\'t even be lying,\" said Susan. \"We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy.\"\"Madness, you mean?\" said the Professor quite coolly. \"Oh, you can make your minds easy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad.\"\"But then,\" said Susan and stopped. She had never dreamed that a grown–up would talk like the Professor and didn\'t know what to think.\"Logic!\" said the Professor half to himself. \"Why don\'t they teach logic at these schools? There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she is telling the truth. You know she doesn\'t tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad. For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth.\"Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that he was not making fun of them.\"But how could it be true, Sir?\" said Peter.\"Why do you say that?\" asked the Professor.\"Well, for one thing,\" said Peter, \"if it was real why doesn\'t everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was nothing there when we looked; even Lucy didn\'t pretend there was.\"\"What has that to do with it?\" said the Professor.\"Well, Sir, if things are real, they\'re there all the time.\"\"Are they?\" said the Professor; and Peter did not know quite what to say.\"But there was no time,\" said Susan, \"Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere, even if there was such a place. She came running after us the very moment we were out of the room. It was less than a minute, and she pretended to have been away for hours.\"\"That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true,\" said the Professor. \"If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other world (and I should warn you that this is a very strange house, and even I know very little about it)—if, I say, she had got into another world, I should not be at all surprised to find that that other world had a separate time of its own; so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time. On the other hand, I don\'t think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves. If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story.\"\"But do you really mean, Sir,\" said Peter, \"that there could be other worlds—all over the place, just round the corner—like that?\"\"Nothing is more probable,\" said the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, \"I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.\"\"But what are we to do?\" said Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the point.\"My dear young lady,\" said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them, \"there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.\"\"What\'s that?\" said Susan.\"We might all try minding our own business,\" said he. And that was the end of that conversation.After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all. It had become a rather alarming subject. And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end; but that was not to be.This house of the Professor\'s—which even he knew so little about—was so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it. It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories; and well it might be, for all manner of stories were told about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now. And when parties of sight–seers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs. Macready, the housekeeper, showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and the rare books in the library. Mrs. Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to be interrupted when she was telling visitors all the things she knew. She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the first morning (along with a good many other instructions) \"And please remember you\'re to keep out of the way whenever I\'m taking a party over the house.\"\"Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown–ups!\" said Edmund, and the other three thought the same. That was how the adventures began for the second time.A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said, \"Look out! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her.\"\"Sharp\'s the word,\" said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room. But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, and realised that Mrs. Macready must be bringing her party of sight–seers up the back stairs—instead of up the front stairs as they had expected. And after that—whether it was that they lost their heads, or that Mrs. Macready was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia—they seemed to find themselves being followed everywhere, until at last Susan said, \"Oh bother those trippers! Here—let\'s get into the Wardrobe Room till they\'ve passed. No one will follow us in there.\" But the moment they were inside they heard voices in the passage—and then someone fumbling at the door—and then they saw the handle turning.\"Quick!\" said Peter, \"there\'s nowhere else,\" and flung open the wardrobe. All four of them bundled inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark. Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for, of course, he remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.'),
(25, 5, 'ch06', 8, ' Chapter VIChapter VIInto the Forest\"I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away,\" said Susan presently, \"I\'m getting horribly cramped.\"\"And what a filthy smell of camphor!\" said Edmund.\"I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it,\" said Susan, \"to keep away moths.\"\"There\'s something sticking into my back,\" said Peter.\"And isn\'t it cold?\" said Susan.\"Now that you mention it, it is cold,\" said Peter, \"and hang it all, it\'s wet too. What\'s the matter with this place? I\'m sitting on something wet. It\'s getting wetter every minute.\" He struggled to his feet.\"Let\'s get out,\" said Edmund, \"they\'ve gone.\"\"O–o–oh!\" said Susan suddenly. And everyone asked her what was the matter.\"I\'m sitting against a tree,\" said Susan, \"and look! It\'s getting lighter—over there.\"\"By jove, you\'re right,\" said Peter, \"and look there—and there. It\'s trees all round. And this wet stuff is snow. Why, I do believe we\'ve got into Lucy\'s wood after all.\"And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front of them were snow–covered trees.Peter turned at once to Lucy.\"I apologise for not believing you,\" he said, \"I\'m sorry. Will you shake hands?\"\"Of course,\" said Lucy, and did.\"And now,\" said Susan, \"what do we do next?\"\"Do?\" said Peter, \"why, go and explore the wood, of course.\"\"Ugh!\" said Susan, stamping her feet, \"it\'s pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?\"\"They\'re not ours,\" said Peter doubtfully.\"I am sure nobody would mind,\" said Susan. \"It isn\'t as if we wanted to take them out of the house; we shan\'t take them even out of the wardrobe.\"\"I never thought of that, Su,\" said Peter. \"Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe.\"They immediately carried out Susan\'s very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on. But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get–up and more suitable to the landscape.\"We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,\" said Lucy.\"This is going to be exciting enough without any pretending,\" said Peter, as he began leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.\"I say,\" began Edmund presently, \"oughtn\'t we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp–post.\" He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before. The moment the words were out of his mouth he realised that he had given himself away. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him. Peter whistled.\"So you really were here,\" he said, \"that time Lu said she\'d met you in here—and you made out she was telling lies.\"There was a dead silence. \"Well, of all the poisonous little beasts—\" said Peter and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say and presently the four resumed their journey; but Edmund was saying to himself, \"I\'ll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck–up, self–satisfied prigs.\"\"Where are we going anyway?\" said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changing the subject.\"I think Lu ought to be the leader,\" said Peter, \"goodness knows she deserves it. Where will you take us, Lu?\"\"What about going to see Mr. Tumnus?\" said Lucy. \"He\'s the nice Faun I told you about.\"Everyone agreed to this and off they went, walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a good leader. At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way, but she recognised an odd–looking tree in one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr. Tumnus\' cave. But there a terrible surprise awaited them.The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days. Snow had drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun\'s father had been slashed into shreds with a knife.\"This is a pretty good wash–out,\" said Edmund, \"not much good coming here.\"\"What\'s this?\" said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor.\"Is there anything written on it?\" asked Susan.\"Yes, I think there is,\" answered Peter, \"but I can\'t read it in this light. Let\'s get out into the open air.\"They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out the following words:—\"The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comforting her said Majesty\'s enemies, harbouring spies and fraternising with Humans.Signed FENRIS ULF, Captain of the Secret Police,LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!\"The children stared at each other.\"I don\'t know that I\'m going to like this place after all,\" said Susan.\"Who is this Queen, Lu?\" said Peter. \"Do you know anything about her?\"\"She isn\'t a real queen at all,\" answered Lucy, \"she\'s a horrible witch, the White Witch. Everyone—all the wood people—hate her. She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas.\"\"I—I wonder if there\'s any point in going on,\" said Susan. \"I mean, it doesn\'t seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won\'t be much fun either. And it\'s getting colder every minute, and we\'ve brought nothing to eat. What about just going home?\"\"Oh, but we can\'t, we can\'t,\" said Lucy suddenly. \"Don\'t you see? We can\'t just go home, not after this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble. He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back. That\'s what it means by comforting the Queen\'s enemies and fraternising with Humans. We simply must try to rescue him.\"\"A lot we could do!\" said Edmund, \"when we haven\'t even got anything to eat!\"\"Shut up—you!\" said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund. \"What do you think, Susan?\"\"I\'ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right,\" said Susan. \"I don\'t want to go a step further and I wish we\'d never come. But I think we must try to do something for Mr. Whatever–his–name is—I mean the Faun.\"\"That\'s what I feel too,\" said Peter. \"I\'m worried about having no food with us. I\'d vote for going back and getting something from the larder, only there doesn\'t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you\'ve got out of it. I think we\'ll have to go on.\"\"So do I,\" said both the girls.\"If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!\" said Peter.They were all still, wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, \"Look! There\'s a robin, with such a red breast. It\'s the first bird I\'ve seen here. I say!—I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us.\" Then she turned to the Robin and said, \"Please, can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?\" As she said this she took a step towards the bird. It at once hopped away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if it understood all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard. (You couldn\'t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye.)\"Do you know,\" said Lucy, \"I really believe he means us to follow him.\"\"I\'ve an idea he does,\" said Susan, \"what do you think, Peter?\"\"Well, we might as well try it,\" answered Peter.The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them but always so near that they could easily follow it. In this way it led them on, slightly down hill. Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch. Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in front, when Edmund said to Peter, \"If you\'re not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I\'ve something to say which you\'d better listen to.\"\"What is it?\" asked Peter.\"Hush! Not so loud,\" said Edmund, \"there\'s no good frightening the girls. But have you realised what we\'re doing?\"\"What?\" said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.\"We\'re following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on? Why shouldn\'t it be leading us into a trap?\"\"That\'s a nasty idea. Still—a robin you know. They\'re good birds in all the stories I\'ve ever read. I\'m sure a robin wouldn\'t be on the wrong side.\"\"If it comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the fauns are in the right and the Queen (yes, I know we\'ve been told she\'s a witch) is in the wrong? We don\'t really know anything about either.\"\"The Faun saved Lucy.\"\"He said he did. But how do we know? And there\'s another thing too. Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here?\"\"Great Scott!\" said Peter, \"I hadn\'t thought of that.\"\"And no chance of dinner either,\" said Edmund.');

(26, 5, 'ch07', 9, ' Chapter VIIChapter VIIA Day With the BeaversWhile the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried \"Oh!\" and stopped. \"The robin!\" cried Lucy, \"the robin. It\'s flown away.\" And so it had—right out of sight.\"And now what are we to do?\" said Edmund, giving Peter a look which was as much as to say \"What did I tell you?\"\"Sh! Look!\" said Susan.\"What?\" said Peter.\"There\'s something moving among the trees—over there to the left.\"They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.\"There it goes again,\" said Susan presently.\"I saw it that time too,\" said Peter. \"It\'s still there. It\'s just gone behind that big tree.\"\"What is it?\" asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.\"Whatever it is,\" said Peter, \"it\'s dodging us. It\'s something that doesn\'t want to be seen.\"\"Let\'s go home,\" said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud, everyone suddenly realised the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter. They were lost.\"What\'s it like?\" said Lucy.\"It\'s—it\'s a kind of animal,\" said Susan; and then, \"Look! Look! Quick! There it is.\"They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree. But this time it didn\'t immediately draw back. Instead, the animal put its paw against its mouth just as humans put their finger on their lips when they are signalling to you to be quiet. Then it disappeared again. The children all stood holding their breaths.A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all round as if it were afraid someone was watching, said \"Hush,\" made signs to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it was standing, and then once more disappeared.\"I know what it is,\" said Peter, \"it\'s a beaver. I saw the tail.\"\"It wants us to go to it,\" said Susan, \"and it is warning us not to make a noise.\"\"I know,\" said Peter. \"The question is are we to go to it or not? What do you think, Lu?\"\"I think it\'s a nice beaver,\" said Lucy.\"Yes, but how do we know?\" said Edmund.\"Shan\'t we have to risk it?\" said Susan. \"I mean, it\'s no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner.\"At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to them.\"Come on,\" said Peter, \"let\'s give it a try. All keep close together. We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy.\"So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it, and there, sure enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew back, saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper, \"Further in, come further in. Right in here. We\'re not safe in the open!\" Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that their boughs met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there, did it begin to talk to them.\"Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?\" it said.\"We\'re some of them,\" said Peter.\"S–s–s–sh!\" said the Beaver, \"not so loud please. We\'re not safe even here.\"\"Why, who are you afraid of?\" said Peter. \"There\'s no one here but ourselves.\"\"There are the trees,\" said the Beaver. \"They\'re always listening. Most of them are on our side, but there are trees that would betray us to her; you know who I mean,\" and it nodded its head several times.\"If it comes to talking about sides,\" said Edmund, \"how do we know you\'re a friend?\"\"Not meaning to be rude, Mr. Beaver,\" added Peter, \"but you see, we\'re strangers.\"\"Quite right, quite right,\" said the Beaver. \"Here is my token.\" With these words it held up to them a little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, till suddenly Lucy said, \"Oh, of course. It\'s my handkerchief—the one I gave to poor Mr. Tumnus.\"\"That\'s right,\" said the Beaver. \"Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me. He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to—\" Here the Beaver\'s voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods. Then signalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could, so that their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers, it added in a low whisper—\"They say Aslan is on the move—perhaps has already landed.\"And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don\'t understand but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning—either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump in his inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous. Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realise that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of summer.\"And what about Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy; \"where is he?\"\"S–s–s–sh,\" said the Beaver, \"not here. I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner.\"No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the Beaver now and everyone, including Edmund, was very glad to hear the word \"dinner.\" They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace, and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over an hour. Everyone was feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply down hill. A minute later they came out under the open sky (the sun was still shining) and found themselves looking down on a fine sight.They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom of which ran—at least it would have been running if it hadn\'t been frozen—a fairly large river. Just below them a dam had been built across this river; and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr. Beaver had made this one. They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his face—the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they\'ve made or reading a story they\'ve written. So it was only common politeness when Susan said, \"What a lovely dam!\" And Mr. Beaver didn\'t say \"Hush\" this time but \"Merely a trifle! Merely a trifle! And it isn\'t really finished!\"Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now of course a level floor of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down, was more ice, but instead of being smooth this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came. And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flowers and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar. And out in the middle, and partly on the top of the dam, was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous bee–hive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed something else. A little lower down the river there was another small river which came down another small valley to join it. And looking up that valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and he was almost sure they were the two hills which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp–post that other day. And then between them, he thought, must be her palace, only a mile off or less. And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King (\"And I wonder how Peter will like that?\" he asked himself) and horrible ideas came into his head.\"Here we are,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and it looks as if Mrs. Beaver is expecting us. I\'ll lead the way. But be careful and don\'t slip.\"The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not (for humans) a very nice place to walk because it was covered with ice, and though the frozen pool was level with it on one side, there was a nasty drop to the lower river on the other. Along this route Mr. Beaver led them in single file right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it. And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house.\"Here we are, Mrs. Beaver,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"I\'ve found them. Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve\"—and they all went in.The first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the first thing she saw was a kind–looking old she–beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine and it was from it that the sound came. She stopped her work and got up as soon as the children came in.\"So you\'ve come at last!\" she said, holding out both her wrinkled old paws. \"At last! To think that ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle\'s singing and I daresay, Mr. Beaver, you\'ll get us some fish.\"\"That I will,\" said Mr. Beaver and he went out of the house (Peter went with him) and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet. They took a pail with them, Mr. Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole (he didn\'t seem to mind it\'s being so chilly) looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in his paw, and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout. Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of fish.Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs. Beaver to fill the the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr. Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house, and to put on the frying pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like Mr. Tumnus\'s cave. There were no books or pictures and instead of beds there were bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall. And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof and against the walls were gum boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying mortar in and fishing rods and fishing nets and sacks. And the cloth on the table tho\' very clean was very rough.Just as the frying pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr. Beaver came in with the fish which Mr. Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air. You can think how good the new–caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mrs. Beaver said, \"Now we\'re nearly ready.\" Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs. Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few minutes everyone was drawing up stools (it was all three–legged stools in the Beavers\' house except for Mrs. Beaver\'s own special rocking chair beside the fire) and preparing to enjoy themselves. There was a jug of creamy milk for the children (Mr. Beaver stuck to beer) and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes and all the children thought—and I agree with them—that there\'s nothing to beat good freshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan half a minute ago. And when they had finished the fish Mrs. Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved the kettle on to the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made and ready to be poured out. And when each person had got his (or her) cup of tea, each person shoved back his (or her) stool so as to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment.\"And now,\" said Mr. Beaver pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards him, \"if you\'ll just wait till I\'ve got my pipe lit up and going nicely—why, now we can get to business. It\'s snowing again,\" he added, cocking his eye at the window. \"That\'s all the better, because it means we shan\'t have any visitors; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you, why he won\'t find any tracks.\"'),
(27, 5, 'ch08', 10, ' Chapter VIIIChapter VIIIWhat Happened After Dinner\"And now,\" said Lucy, \"do please tell us what\'s happened to Mr. Tumnus.\"\"Ah, that\'s bad,\" said Mr. Beaver shaking his head. \"That\'s a very, very bad business. There\'s no doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that from a bird who saw it done.\"\"But where\'s he been taken to?\" asked Lucy.\"Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means.\"\"No, we don\'t,\" said Susan. But Mr. Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion.\"I\'m afraid it means they were taking him to her house,\" said Mr. Beaver.\"But what\'ll they do to him, Mr. Beaver?\" gasped Lucy.\"Well,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"you can\'t exactly say for sure. But there\'s not many taken in there that ever comes out again. Statues. All full of statues they say it is—in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall. People she\'s turned—\" (he paused and shuddered) \"turned into stone.\"\"But, Mr. Beaver,\" said Lucy, \"can\'t we—I mean we must do something to save him. It\'s too dreadful and it\'s all on my account.\"\"I don\'t doubt you\'d save him if you could, dearie,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"but you\'ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive.\"\"Couldn\'t we have some stratagem?\" said Peter. \"I mean couldn\'t we dress up as something, or pretend to be—oh, pedlars or anything—or watch till she was gone out—or—oh, hang it all, there must be some way. This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, Mr. Beaver. We can\'t just leave him to be—to be—to have that done to him.\"\"It\'s no good, Son of Adam,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"no good your trying, of all people. But now that Aslan is on the move—\"\"Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!\" said several voices at once; for once again that strange feeling—like the first signs of spring, like good news, had come over them.\"Who is Aslan?\" asked Susan.\"Aslan?\" said Mr. Beaver, \"Why don\'t you know? He\'s the King. He\'s the Lord of the whole wood, but not often here, you understand. Never in my time or my father\'s time. But the word has reached us that he has come back. He is in Narnia at this moment. He\'ll settle the White Queen all right. It is he, not you, that will save Mr. Tumnus.\"\"She won\'t turn him into stone too?\" said Edmund.\"Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!\" answered Mr. Beaver with a great laugh. \"Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it\'ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her. No, no. He\'ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:—Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,When he bares his teeth, winter meets its deathAnd when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.You\'ll understand when you see him.\"\"But shall we see him?\" asked Susan.\"Why, Daughter of Eve, that\'s what I brought you here for. I\'m to lead you where you shall meet him,\" said Mr. Beaver.\"Is—is he a man?\" asked Lucy.\"Aslan a man!\" said Mr. Beaver sternly. \"Certainly not. I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor–Beyond–the–Sea. Don\'t you know who is the King of Beasts? Aslan is a lion—the Lion, the great Lion.\"\"Ooh!\" said Susan, \"I\'d thought he was a man. Is he—quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.\"\"That you will, dearie, and no mistake,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"if there\'s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they\'re either braver than most or else just silly.\"\"Then he isn\'t safe?\" said Lucy.\"Safe?\" said Mr. Beaver. \"Don\'t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? \'Course he isn\'t safe. But he\'s good. He\'s the King, I tell you.\"\"I\'m longing to see him,\" said Peter, \"even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point.\"\"That\'s right, Son of Adam,\" said Mr. Beaver bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle. \"And so you shall. Word has been sent that you are to meet him, to–morrow if you can, at the Stone Table.\"\"Where\'s that?\" said Lucy.\"I\'ll show you,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"It\'s down the river, a good step from here. I\'ll take you to it!\"\"But meanwhile what about poor Mr. Tumnus?\" said Lucy.\"The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"once he\'s with us, then we can begin doing things. Not that we don\'t need you too. For that\'s another of the old rhymes:—When Adam\'s flesh and Adam\'s boneSits at Cair Paravel in throne,The evil time will be over and done.So things must be drawing near their end now he\'s come and you\'ve come. We\'ve heard of Aslan coming into these parts before—long ago, nobody can say when. But there\'s never been any of your race here before.\"\"That\'s what I don\'t understand, Mr. Beaver,\" said Peter, \"I mean isn\'t the Witch herself human?\"\"She\'d like us to believe it,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and it\'s on that that she bases her claim to be Queen. But she\'s no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your father Adam\'s—\" (here Mr. Beaver bowed) \"your father Adam\'s first wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That\'s what she comes from on one side. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no, there isn\'t a drop of real Human blood in the Witch.\"\"That\'s why she\'s bad all through, Mr. Beaver,\" said Mrs. Beaver.\"True enough, Mrs. Beaver,\" replied he, \"there may be two views about Humans (meaning no offence to the present company). But there\'s no two views about things that look like Humans and aren\'t.\"\"I\'ve known good dwarfs,\" said Mrs. Beaver.\"So\'ve I, now you come to speak of it,\" said her husband, \"but precious few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that\'s going to be Human and isn\'t yet, or used to be Human once and isn\'t now, or ought to be Human and isn\'t, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. And that\'s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any Humans in Narnia. She\'s been watching for you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she\'d be more dangerous still.\"\"What\'s that to do with it?\" asked Peter.\"Because of another prophecy,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"Down at Cair Paravel—that\'s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be—down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it\'s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch\'s reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn\'t be worth a shake of my whiskers!\"All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr. Beaver was telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark, Lucy suddenly said:\"I say—where\'s Edmund?\"There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking \"Who saw him last? How long has he been missing? Is he outside?\" And then all rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction. \"Edmund! Edmund!\" they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.\"How perfectly dreadful!\" said Susan as they at last came back in despair. \"Oh, how I wish we\'d never come.\"\"What on earth are we to do, Mr. Beaver?\" said Peter.\"Do?\" said Mr. Beaver who was already putting on his snow boots, \"do? We must be off at once. We haven\'t a moment to spare!\"\"We\'d better divide into four search parties,\" said Peter, \"and all go in different directions. Whoever finds him must come back here at once and—\"\"Search parties, Son of Adam?\" said Mr. Beaver; \"what for?\"\"Why, to look for Edmund of course!\"\"There\'s no point in looking for him,\" said Mr. Beaver.\"What do you mean?\" said Susan, \"he can\'t be far away yet. And we\'ve got to find him. What do you mean when you say there\'s no use looking for him?\"\"The reason there\'s no use looking,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"is that we know already where he\'s gone!\" Everyone stared in amazement. \"Don\'t you understand?\" said Mr. Beaver. \"He\'s gone to her, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all.\"\"Oh surely—oh really!\" said Susan, \"he can\'t have done that.\"\"Can\'t he?\" said Mr. Beaver looking very hard at the three children, and everything they wanted to say died on their lips for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done.\"But will he know the way?\" said Peter.\"Has he been in this country before?\" asked Mr. Beaver, \"has he ever been here alone?\"\"Yes,\" said Lucy almost in a whisper, \"I\'m afraid he has.\"\"And did he tell you what he\'d done or who he\'d met?\"\"Well, no, he didn\'t,\" said Peter.\"Then mark my words,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"he has already met the White Witch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn\'t like to mention it before (he being your brother and all) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself \'Treacherous.\' He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell them if you\'ve lived long in Narnia, something about their eyes.\"\"All the same,\" said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, \"we\'ll still have to go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast, and he\'s only a kid.\"\"Go to the Witch\'s house?\" said Mrs. Beaver. \"Don\'t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?\"\"How do you mean?\" said Lucy.\"Why all she wants is to get all four of you (she\'s thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her house her job would be done—and there\'d be four new statues in her collection before you\'d had time to speak. But she\'ll keep him alive as long as he\'s the only one she\'s got, because she\'ll want to use him as a decoy; as bait to catch the rest of you with.\"\"Oh, can no one help us?\" wailed Lucy.\"Only Aslan,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"we must go on and meet him. That\'s our only chance now.\"\"It seems to me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"that it is very important to know just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard. For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he left? If not, then we may do very well, for she won\'t know that Aslan has come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned.\"\"I don\'t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan—\" began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.\"Oh yes, he was,\" she said miserably; \"don\'t you remember, it was he who asked whether the Witch couldn\'t turn Aslan into stone too?\"\"So he did, by Jove,\" said Peter, \"just the sort of thing he would say, too!\"\"Worse and worse,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and the next thing is this. Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?\"And of course no one knew the answer to this question.\"Because, if he was,\" continued Mr. Beaver, \"then she\'ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan.\"\"But that isn\'t what she\'ll do first,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"not if I know her. The moment that Edmund tells her that we\'re all here she\'ll set out to catch us this very night, and if he\'s been gone about half an hour, she\'ll be here in about another twenty minutes.\"\"You\'re right, Mrs. Beaver,\" said her husband, \"we must all get away from here. There\'s not a moment to lose.\"'),
(28, 5, 'ch09', 11, ' Chapter IXChapter IXIn the Witch\'s HouseAnd now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He had eaten his share of the dinner, but he hadn\'t really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight—and there\'s nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad magic food. And he had heard the conversation and hadn\'t enjoyed it much either, because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder. They weren\'t, but he imagined it. And then he had listened until Mr. Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling.Just as Mr. Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam\'s flesh and Adam\'s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door handle; and just before Mr. Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn\'t really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him.You mustn\'t think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince (and later a King) and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he didn\'t want her to be particularly nice to them—certainly not to put them on the same level as himself—but he managed to believe, or to pretend he believed, that she wouldn\'t do anything very bad to them, \"Because,\" he said to himself, \"all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it isn\'t true. She was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she is the rightful Queen really. Anyway, she\'ll be better than that awful Aslan!\" At least, that was the excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn\'t a very good excuse, however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel.The first thing he realised when he got outside and found the snow falling all around him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers\' house. And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now. The next thing he realised was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly three o\'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He hadn\'t reckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn\'t so slippery since the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river.It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feet ahead. And then too there was no road. He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and tripping over fallen tree–trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his shins against rocks, till he was wet and cold and bruised all over. The silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the others, if he hadn\'t happened to say to himself, \"When I\'m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads.\" And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal. He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting the finishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold. Finally, the clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made everything almost as bright as day—only the shadows were rather confusing.He would never have found his way if the moon hadn\'t come out by the time he got to the other river—you remember he had seen (when they first arrived at the Beavers\') a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down. He now reached this and turned to follow it up. But the little valley down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bushes, so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark. Even as it was, he got wet through for he had to stoop to go under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his back. And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter—just as if all this had been Peter\'s fault.But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. And there, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle of a little plain between two hills, he saw what must be the White Witch\'s house. And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The house was really a small castle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers with long pointed spires on them, sharp as needles. They looked like huge dunce\'s caps or sorcerer\'s caps. And they shone in the moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow! Edmund began to be afraid of the house.But it was too late to think of turning back now. He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the house. There was nothing stirring; not the slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow. He walked on and on, past corner after corner of the house, and past turret after turret to find the door. He had to go right round to the far side before he found it. It was a huge arch but the great iron gates stood wide open.Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch, afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his knees knocking together. He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear. How long this really lasted I don\'t know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still—for it hadn\'t moved one inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could. He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn\'t have been looking at him at all. (\"But supposing it turns its head?\" thought Edmund.) In fact it was staring at something else—namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about four feet away. \"Aha!\" thought Edmund. \"When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape.\" But still the lion never moved, nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that the lion\'s back and the top of its head were covered with snow. Of course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow. Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion. Even now he hardly dared to touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. It was cold stone. He had been frightened of a mere statue!The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toes, and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea. \"Probably,\" he thought, \"this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She\'s caught him already and turned him into stone. So that\'s the end of all their fine ideas about him! Pooh! Who\'s afraid of Aslan?\"And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did something very silly and childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion\'s upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes. Then he said, \"Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you like being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn\'t you?\" But in spite of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the moonlight that Edmund didn\'t really get any fun out of jeering at it. He turned away and began to cross the courtyard.As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about—standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess board when it is half way through the game. There were stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat–a–mountains of stone. There were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees. There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon. They all looked so strange standing there perfectly lifelike and also perfectly still, in the bright cold moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like going past it.He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard. He went to it, there was a flight of stone steps going up to an open door. Edmund went up them. Across the threshold lay a great wolf:\"It\'s all right, it\'s all right,\" he kept saying to himself, \"it\'s only a stone wolf. It can\'t hurt me,\" and he raised his leg to step over it. Instantly the huge creature rose, with all the hair bristling along its back, opened a great, red mouth and said in a growling voice,\"Who\'s there? Who\'s there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are.\"\"If you please, Sir,\" said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly speak, \"my name is Edmund, and I\'m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I\'ve come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia—quite close, in the Beavers\' house. She—she wanted to see them.\"\"I will tell Her Majesty,\" said the Wolf. \"Meanwhile, stand still on the threshold, as you value your life.\" Then it vanished into the house.Edmund stood and waited, his fingers aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest, and presently the grey Wolf, Fenris Ulf, the Chief of the Witch\'s Secret Police, came bounding back and said, \"Come in! Come in! Fortunate favourite of the Queen—or else not so fortunate.\"And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf\'s paws.He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as the courtyard had been, of statues. The one nearest the door was a little Faun with a very sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn\'t help wondering if this might be Lucy\'s friend. The only light came from a single lamp and close behind this sat the White Witch.\"I\'m come, your Majesty,\" said Edmund rushing eagerly forward.\"How dare you come alone?\" said the Witch in a terrible voice. \"Did I not tell you to bring the others with you?\"\"Please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, \"I\'ve done the best I can. I\'ve brought them quite close. They\'re in the little house on top of the dam just up the river—with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.\"A slow cruel smile came over the Witch\'s face.\"Is this all your news?\" she asked.\"No, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the Beavers\' house.\"What! Aslan?\" cried the Queen, \"Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have lied to me—\"\"Please, I\'m only repeating what they said,\" stammered Edmund.But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands. Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.\"Make ready our sledge,\" ordered the Witch, \"and use the harness without bells.\"');

(29, 5, 'ch10', 12, ' Chapter XChapter XThe Spell Begins to BreakNow we must go back to Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and the three other children. As soon as Mr. Beaver said \"There\'s no time to lose\" everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs. Beaver who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said: \"Now, Mr. Beaver, just reach down that ham. And here\'s a packet of tea, and there\'s sugar, and some matches. And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner.\"\"What are you doing, Mrs. Beaver?\" exclaimed Susan.\"Packing a load for each of us, dearie,\" said Mrs. Beaver very coolly. \"You didn\'t think we\'d set out on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?\"\"But we haven\'t time!\" said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat. \"She may be here any minute.\"\"That\'s what I say,\" chimed in Mr. Beaver.\"Get along with you all,\" said his wife. \"Think it over, Mr. Beaver. She can\'t be here for a quarter of an hour at least.\"\"But don\'t we want as big a start as we can possibly get,\" said Peter, \"if we\'re to reach the Stone Table before her?\"\"You\'ve got to remember that, Mrs. Beaver,\" said Susan. \"As soon as she has looked in here and finds we\'re gone she\'ll be off at top speed.\"\"That she will,\" said Mrs. Beaver. \"But we can\'t get there before her whatever we do, for she\'ll be on a sledge and we\'ll be walking.\"\"Then—have we no hope?\" said Susan.\"Now don\'t you get fussing, there\'s a dear,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"but just get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of that drawer. \'Course we\'ve got a hope. We can\'t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she won\'t expect and perhaps we\'ll get through.\"\"That\'s true enough, Mrs. Beaver,\" said her husband. \"But it\'s time we were out of this.\"\"And don\'t you start fussing either, Mr. Beaver,\" said his wife. \"There. That\'s better. There\'s four loads and the smallest for the smallest of us: that\'s you, my dear,\" she added looking at Lucy.\"Oh, do please come on,\" said Lucy.\"Well, I\'m nearly ready now,\" answered Mrs. Beaver at last allowing her husband to help her into her snow boots. \"I suppose the sewing machine\'s too heavy to bring?\"\"Yes. It is,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"A great deal too heavy. And you don\'t think you\'ll be able to use it while we\'re on the run, I suppose?\"\"I can\'t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"and breaking it or stealing it, as likely as not.\"\"Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!\" said the three children. And so at last they all got outside and Mr. Beaver locked the door (\"It\'ll delay her a bit,\" he said) and they set off, all carrying their loads over their shoulders.The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. They went in single file—first Mr. Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs. Beaver last of all. Mr. Beaver led them across the dam and onto the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river–bank. The sides of the valley, shining in the moonlight, towered up far above them on either hand. \"Best keep down here as much as possible,\" he said. \"She\'ll have to keep to the top, for you couldn\'t bring a sledge down here.\"It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they went on walking and walking—and walking—and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how she was going to keep up at all. And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree–tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr. Beaver going pad–pad–pad–pad through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr. Beaver had turned away from the river bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes. And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr. Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time she realised what was happening, only his short flat tail was showing.Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heard noises of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside.\"Wherever is this?\" said Peter\'s voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness. (I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)\"It\'s an old hiding–place for beavers in bad times,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and a great secret. It\'s not much of a place but we must get a few hours\' sleep.\"\"If you hadn\'t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I\'d have brought some pillows,\" said Mrs. Beaver.It wasn\'t nearly such a nice cave as Mr. Tumnus\'s, Lucy thought—just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of fur and clothes together, and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug. If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother! Then Mrs. Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something—it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you\'d swallowed it—and everyone went straight to sleep.It seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and hours later) when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave. But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyone else. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open, listening to a sound which was the very sound they\'d all been thinking of (and sometimes imagining they heard) during their walk last night. It was a sound of jingling bells.Mr. Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it. Perhaps you think, as Lucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing for him to do? But it was really a very sensible one. He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen; and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch\'s sledge went. The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering. They waited nearly five minutes. Then they heard something that frightened them very much. They heard voices. \"Oh,\" thought Lucy, \"he\'s been seen. She\'s caught him!\"Great was their surprise when, a little later, they heard Mr. Beaver\'s voice calling to them from just outside the cave.\"It\'s all right,\" he was shouting. \"Come out, Mrs. Beaver. Come out, Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve. It\'s all right! It isn\'t her!\" This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia—in our world they usually don\'t talk at all.So Mrs. Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all blinking in the daylight, and with earth all over them, and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eyes.\"Come on!\" cried Mr. Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight. \"Come and see! This is a nasty knock for the Witch! It looks as if her power was already crumbling.\"\"What do you mean, Mr. Beaver?\" panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together.\"Didn\'t I tell you,\" answered Mr. Beaver, \"that she\'d made it always winter and never Christmas? Didn\'t I tell you? Well, just come and see!\"And then they were all at the top and did see.It was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they were far bigger than the Witch\'s reindeer, and they were not white but brown. And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eyes on him. He was a huge man in a bright red robe (bright as holly–berries) with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest. Everyone knew him because, though you see people of his sort only in Narnia, you see pictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world—the world on this side of the wardrobe door. But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different. Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly. But now that the children actually stood looking at him they didn\'t find it quite like that. He was so big, and so glad, and so real, that they all became quite still. They felt very glad, but also solemn.\"I\'ve come at last,\" said he. \"She has kept me out for a long time, but I have got in at last. Aslan is on the move. The Witch\'s magic is weakening.\"And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being solemn and still.\"And now,\" said Father Christmas, \"for your presents. There is a new and better sewing machine for you, Mrs. Beaver. I will drop it in your house as I pass.\"\"If you please, sir,\" said Mrs. Beaver, making a curtsey. \"It\'s locked up.\"\"Locks and bolts make no difference to me,\" said Father Christmas. \"And as for you, Mr. Beaver, when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluice gate fitted.\"Mr. Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn\'t say anything at all.\"Peter, Adam\'s Son,\" said Father Christmas.\"Here, Sir,\" said Peter.\"These are your presents,\" was the answer, \"and they are tools not toys. The time to use them is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.\" With these words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword. The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.\"Susan, Eve\'s Daughter,\" said Father Christmas. \"These are for you,\" and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. \"You must use the bow only in great need,\" he said, \"for I do not mean you to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to your lips and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will come to you.\"Last of all he said, \"Lucy, Eve\'s Daughter,\" and Lucy came forward. He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass (but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond) and a small dagger. \"In this bottle,\" he said, \"there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire–flowers that grow in the mountains of the sun. If you or any of your friends are hurt, a few drops of this will restore you. And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need. For you also are not to be in the battle.\"\"Why, Sir,\" said Lucy. \"I think—I don\'t know—but I think I could be brave enough.\"\"That is not the point,\" he said. \"But battles are ugly when women fight. And now\"—here he suddenly looked less grave—\"here is something for the moment for you all!\" and he brought out (I suppose from the big bag at his back, but nobody quite saw him do it) a large tray containing five cups and saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot. Then he cried out \"A Merry Christmas! Long live the true King!\" and cracked his whip and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started.Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr. Beaver when Mrs. Beaver said:\"Now then, now then! Don\'t stand talking there till the tea\'s got cold. Just like men. Come and help to carry the tray down and we\'ll have breakfast. What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread–knife.\"So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr. Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs. Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed himself. But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr. Beaver said, \"Time to be moving on now.\"'),
(30, 5, 'ch11', 13, ' Chapter XIChapter XIAslan is NearerEdmund meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When the Dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him, as she had been at their last meeting. But she said nothing at all. And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say, \"Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight? You—you—said—\" she answered, \"Silence, fool!\" Then she appeared to change her mind and said, as if to herself, \"And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way,\" and once more clapped her hands. Another dwarf appeared. \"Bring the human creature food and drink,\" she said. The Dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He grinned in a repulsive manner as he set them down the floor beside Edmund and said:\"Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha! Ha! Ha!\"\"Take it away,\" said Edmund sulkily. \"I don\'t want dry bread.\" But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he apologised and began to nibble at the bread, though it was so stale he could hardly get it down.\"You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again,\" said the Witch.While he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge was ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmund to go with her. The snow was again falling as they came into the courtyard but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge. But before they drove off she called Fenris Ulf and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge.\"Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers,\" said the Witch, \"and kill whatever you find there. If they are already gone, then make all speed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen. Wait for me there in hiding. I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river. You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table. You will know what to do if you find them!\"\"I hear and obey, O Queen,\" growled the Wolf; and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few minutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam and sniffing at the Beavers\' house. But of course they found it empty. It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fine, for the wolves would then have been able to follow their trail—and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave. But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the footprints were covered up.Meanwhile the Dwarf whipped up the reindeer and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold. This was a terrible journey for Edmund who had no coat. Before they had been going a quarter of ah hour all the front of him was covered with snow—he soon stopped trying to shake it off because, as quickly as he did that, a new lot gathered, and he was so tired. Soon he was wet to the skin. And oh, how miserable he was. It didn\'t look now as if the Witch intended to make him a King! All the things he had said to make himself believe that she was good and kind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now. He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment—even Peter! The only way to comfort himself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he might wake up at any moment. And as they went on, hour after hour, it did come to seem like a dream.This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it. But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight. And still they went on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer\'s harness. And then at last the Witch said, \"What have we here? Stop!\" and they did.How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast! But she had stopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party, a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dog–fox, all on stools round a table. Edmund couldn\'t quite see what they were eating, but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn\'t at all sure that he didn\'t see something like a plum pudding. At the moment when the sledge stopped, the Fox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just risen to its feet, holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say something. But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork half–way to his mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squealed with terror.\"What is the meaning of this?\" asked the Witch Queen. Nobody answered.\"Speak, vermin!\" she said again. \"Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip? What is the meaning of all this gluttony, this waste, this self indulgence? Where did you get all these things?\"\"Please, your Majesty,\" said the Fox, \"we were given them. And if I might make so bold as to drink your Majesty\'s very good health—\"\"Who gave them to you?\" said the Witch.\"F–F–F–Father Christmas,\" stammered the Fox.\"What?\" roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few strides nearer to the terrified animals. \"He has not been here! He cannot have been here! How dare you—but no. Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven.\"At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.\"He has—he has—he has!\" it squeaked beating its little spoon on the table. Edmund saw the Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek. Then she raised her wand. \"Oh don\'t, don\'t, please don\'t,\" shouted Edmund, but even while he was shouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statues of creatures (one with its stone fork fixed forever half–way to its stone mouth) seated round a stone table on which there were stone plates and a stone plum pudding.\"As for you,\" said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she re–mounted the sledge, \"let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors. Drive on!\" And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself. It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grew on them and at last even their faces crumbled away.Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all last night. At the same time he noticed that he was feeling much less cold. It was also becoming foggy. In fact every minute it grew both foggier and warmer. And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had been running up till now. At first he thought this was because the reindeer were tired, but soon he saw that that couldn\'t be the real reason. The sledge jerked, and skidded, and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones. And however the Dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower. There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them but the noise of their driving and jolting and the Dwarf\'s shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was, until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn\'t go on at all. When that happened there was a moment\'s silence. And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling, chattering noise—and yet not so strange, for he knew he\'d heard it before—if only he could remember where! Then all at once he did remember. It was the noise of running water. All round them, though out of sight, there were streams chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even (in the distance) roaring. And his heart gave a great leap (though he hardly knew why) when he realised that the frost was over. And much nearer there was a drip–drip–drip from the branches of all the trees. And then, as he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree. But he hadn\'t time to listen or watch any longer for the Witch said:\"Don\'t sit staring, fool! Get out and help.\"And of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow—but it was really only slush by now—and began helping the Dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into. They got it out in the end, and by being very cruel to the reindeer the Dwarf managed to get it on the move again, and they drove a little further. And now the snow was really melting in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction. Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after the endless white. Then the sledge stopped again.\"It\'s no good, your Majesty,\" said the Dwarf. \"We can\'t sledge in this thaw.\"\"Then we must walk,\" said the Witch.\"We shall never overtake them walking,\" growled the dwarf. \"Not with the start they\'ve got.\"\"Are you my councillor or my slave?\" said the Witch. \"Do as you\'re told. Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope. And take your whip. And cut the harness of the reindeer; they\'ll find their own way home.\"The Dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forced to walk as fast as he could with his hands tied behind him. He kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass, and every time he slipped the Dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip. The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying, \"Faster! Faster!\"Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of snow grew smaller. Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow. Soon, wherever you looked, instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms. Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether. Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down onto the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree–tops.Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers—celandines. The noise of water grew louder. Presently they actually crossed a stream. Beyond it they found snowdrops growing.\"Mind your own business!\" said the Dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his head to look at them; and he gave the rope a vicious jerk.But of course this didn\'t prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree—gold and purple and white. Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water. Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off. And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds\' music, and wherever Edmund\'s eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or having their little quarrels.\"Faster! Faster!\" said the Witch.There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide glades there were primroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces of the travellers. The trees began to come fully alive. The larches and birches were covered with green, the laburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves. As the travellers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed across their path.\"This is no thaw,\" said the Dwarf, suddenly stopping. \"This is spring. What are we to do? Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is Aslan\'s doing.\"\"If either of you mention that name again,\" said the Witch, \"he shall instantly be killed.\"'),
(31, 5, 'ch12', 14, ' Chapter XIIChapter XIIPeter\'s First BattleWhile the Dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beaver and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats behind them. And by now they had even stopped saying to one another, \"Look! There\'s a kingfisher!\" or \"I say, bluebells!\" or \"What was that lovely smell?\" or \"Just listen to that thrush!\" They walked on in silence drinking it all in, passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense masses of flowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost overpowering.They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May. They hadn\'t even known for certain (as the Witch did) that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch\'s schemes. And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge. After that they didn\'t hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer ones. They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I\'d call bitterly tired—only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open. Susan had a slight blister on one heel.They had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to turn a little to the right (that meant a little to the South) to reach the place of the Stone Table. Even if this had not been their way, they couldn\'t have kept to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood—a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood—and their path would have been under water.And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and the flowers began to think about closing.\"Not long now,\" said Mr. Beaver, and began leading them uphill across some very deep, springy moss (it felt nice under their tired feet) in a place where only tall trees grew, very wide apart. The climb, coming at the end of the long day, made them all pant and blow. And just as Lucy was wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly they were at the top. And this is what they saw.They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction—except right ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving. \"By gum!\" whispered Peter to Susan. \"The sea!\" In the very middle of this open hilltop was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stones. It looked very old; and it was cut all over with strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language. They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was—and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it—with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent–pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole a banner, which bore a red rampant lion, fluttered in the breeze which was blowing in their faces from the far–off sea. While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see.Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves around him in the shape of a half–moon. There were Tree–Women there and Well–Women (Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in our world) who had stringed instruments; it was they who had made the music. There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants. There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and a great dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard.But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn\'t know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan\'s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn\'t look at him and went all trembly.\"Go on,\" whispered Mr. Beaver.\"No,\" whispered Peter, \"you first.\"\"No, Sons of Adam before animals,\" whispered Mr. Beaver back again.\"Susan,\" whispered Peter, \"what about you? Ladies first.\"\"No, you\'re the eldest,\" whispered Susan. And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realised that it was up to him. He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others \"Come on. Pull yourselves together,\" he advanced to the Lion and said:\"We have come—Aslan.\"\"Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,\" said Aslan. \"Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve. Welcome He–Beaver and She–Beaver.\"His voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them. They now felt glad and quiet and it didn\'t seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing.\"But where is the fourth?\" asked Aslan.\"He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan,\" said Mr. Beaver. And then something made Peter say:\"That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong.\"And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great golden eyes. And it seemed to all of them that there was nothing to be said.\"Please—Aslan,\" said Lucy, \"can anything be done to save Edmund?\"\"All shall be done,\" said Aslan. \"But it may be harder than you think.\" And then he was silent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked; now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad as well. But next minute that expression was quite gone. The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paws together (\"Terrible paws,\" thought Lucy, \"If he didn\'t know how to velvet them!\") and said:\"Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them.\"When the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw—and though it was velveted it was very heavy—on Peter\'s shoulder and said, \"Come, Son of Adam, and I will show you a far–off sight of the castle where you are to be King.\"And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hill–top. There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs. That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light—forest and hills and valleys and, winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river. And beyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset. But just where the land of Narnia met the sea—in fact, at the mouth of the great river—there was something on a little hill, shining. It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight was reflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset; but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore.\"That, O Man,\" said Aslan, \"is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one of which you must sit as King. I show it to you because you are the first–born and you will be High King over all the rest.\"And once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly. It was like a bugle, but richer.\"It is your sister\'s horn,\" said Aslan to Peter in a low voice; so low as to be almost a purr, if it is not disrespectful to think of a lion purring.For a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he saw all the other creatures start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw, \"Back! Let the Prince win his spurs,\" he did understand, and set off running as hard as he could to the pavilion. And there he saw a dreadful sight.The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was running towards him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as white as paper. Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree, and swing herself up, followed by a huge grey beast. At first Peter thought it was a bear. Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big to be a dog. Then he realised that it was a wolf—a wolf standing on its hind legs, with its front paws against the tree–trunk snapping and snarling. All the hair on its back stood up on end. Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch. One of her legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snapping teeth. Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip; then he realised that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off.Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But that made no difference to what he had to do. He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side. That stroke never reached the Wolf. Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and its mouth wide open in a howl of anger. If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once. As it was—though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all—he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword, as hard as he could, between the brute\'s forelegs into its heart. Then came a horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare. He was tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knocked against his forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair. A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and was straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes. He felt tired all over.Then, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I won\'t say there wasn\'t kissing and crying on both sides. But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of you for that.\"Quick! Quick!\" shouted the voice of Aslan, \"Centaurs! Eagles! I see another wolf in the thickets. There—behind you. He has just darted away. After him, all of you! He will be going to his mistress. Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam.\" And instantly with a thunder of hoofs and a beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest creatures disappeared into the gathering darkness.Peter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.\"You have forgotten to clean your sword,\" said Aslan.It was true. Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf\'s hair and blood. He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass, and then wiped it quite dry on his coat.\"Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam,\" said Aslan. And when Peter had done so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said, \"Rise up, Sir Peter Fenris–Bane. And, whatever happens, never forget to wipe your sword.\"'),
(32, 5, 'ch13', 15, ' Chapter XIIIChapter XIIIDeep Magic From the Dawn of TimeNow we must go back to Edmund. When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face, doing nothing at all and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let him lie still. He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was. The Witch and the Dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.\"No,\" said the Dwarf, \"it is no use now, O Queen. They must have reached the Stone Table by now.\"\"Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,\" said the Witch.\"It cannot be good news if he does,\" said the Dwarf.\"Four thrones in Cair Paravel,\" said the Witch. \"How if only three were filled? That would not fulfil the prophecy.\"\"What difference would that make now that he is here?\" said the Dwarf. He did not dare, even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.\"He may not stay long. And then—we would fall upon the three at Cair.\"\"Yet it might be better,\" said the Dwarf, \"to keep this one\" (here he kicked Edmund) \"for bargaining with.\"\"Yes! And have him rescued,\" said the Witch scornfully.\"Then,\" said the Dwarf, \"we had better do what we have to do at once.\"\"I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself,\" said the Witch. \"That is the proper place. That is where it has always been done before.\"\"It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use,\" said the Dwarf.\"True,\" said the Witch; and then, \"Well, I will begin.\"At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.\"I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with him. They have killed my captain, Fenris Ulf. I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all. One of the Sons of Adam killed him. Fly! Fly!\"\"No,\" said the Witch. \"There need be no flying. Go quickly. Summon all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can. Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side. Call the Ghouls, and the Boggles, the Ogres and the Minotaurs. Call the Cruels, the Hags, the Spectres, and the people of the Toadstools. We will fight. What? Have I not still my wand? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on? Be off quickly, I have a little thing to finish here while you are away.\"The great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.\"Now!\" said she, \"we have no table—let me see. We had better put it against the trunk of a tree.\"Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the Dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast. He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle. Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly white. Because they were so very white he could not see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.\"Prepare the victim,\" said the Witch. And the Dwarf undid Edmund\'s collar and folded back his shirt at the neck. Then he took Edmund\'s hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin. After that Edmund heard a strange noise—whizz—whizz—whizz. For a moment he couldn\'t think what it was. Then he realised. It was the sound of a knife being sharpened!At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction—a drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings—a scream from the Witch—confusion all round him. And then he found he was being untied. Strong arms were round him and he heard big, kind voices saying things like \"Let him lie down—give him some wine—drink this—steady now—you\'ll be all right in a minute.\"Then he heard the voices of people who were talking not to him but to one another. And they were saying things like \"Who\'s got the Witch?—I thought you had her—I didn\'t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand—I was after the Dwarf—Do you mean to say she\'s escaped?—A chap can\'t mind everything at once—What\'s that? Oh sorry it\'s only an old stump!\" But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint.Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds (they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter) all set off to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them. But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone, I think they might have been surprised.It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright, if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree–stump and on a fair sized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the stump and the boulder. And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground. And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump; for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the Dwarf. For it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they weren\'t, and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife was knocked out of her hand. She had kept hold of her wand also, so it had been kept safe, too.When the other children woke up next morning (they had been sleeping on piles of cushions in the pavilion) the first thing they heard—from Mrs. Beaver—was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night; and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had breakfasted they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass, apart from the rest of the court. There is no need to tell you (and no one ever heard) what Aslan was saying but it was a conversation which Edmund never forgot. As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them bringing Edmund with him.\"Here is your brother,\" he said, \"and—there is no need to talk to him about what is past.\"Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in turn, \"I\'m sorry,\" and everyone said \"That\'s all right.\" And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friends with him again—something ordinary and natural—and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said:\"Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.\"\"Let him approach,\" said Aslan.The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch\'s Dwarf.\"What is your message, Son of Earth?\" asked Aslan.\"The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak with you,\" said the Dwarf, \"on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers.\"\"Queen of Narnia, indeed!\" said Mr. Beaver. \"Of all the cheek—\"\"Peace, Beaver,\" said Aslan. \"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Tell your mistress, Son of Earth, that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wand behind her at that great oak.\"This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the Dwarf to see that the conditions were properly carried out. \"But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone?\" whispered Lucy to Peter. I think the same idea had occurred to the leopards themselves; at any rate, as they walked off their fur was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling—like a cat\'s when it sees a strange dog.\"It\'ll be all right,\" whispered Peter in reply. \"He wouldn\'t send them if it weren\'t.\"A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children, who had not seen her before, felt shudders running down their backs at the sight of her face; and there were low growls among all the animals present. Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces—the golden face and the dead–white face—so close together. Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs. Beaver particularly noticed this.\"You have a traitor there, Aslan,\" said the Witch. Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he\'d been through and after the talk he\'d had that morning. He just went on looking at Aslan. It didn\'t seem to matter what the Witch said.\"Well,\" said Aslan. \"His offence was not against you.\"\"Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?\" asked the Witch.\"Let us say I have forgotten it,\" answered Aslan gravely. \"Tell us of this Deep Magic.\"\"Tell you?\" said the Witch, her voice growing suddenly shriller. \"Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us? Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the trunk of the World Ash Tree? Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor–Beyond–the–Sea? You at least know the magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning. You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill.\"\"Oh,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"So that\'s how you came to imagine yourself a Queen—because you were the Emperor\'s hangman. I see.\"\"Peace, Beaver,\" said Aslan, with a very low growl.\"And so,\" continued the Witch, \"that human creature is mine. His life is forfeit to me. His blood is my property.\"\"Come and take it then,\" said the Bull with the man\'s head in a great bellowing voice.\"Fool,\" said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl, \"do you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force? He knows the Deep Magic better than that. He knows that unless I have blood as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water.\"\"It is very true,\" said Aslan; \"I do not deny it.\"\"Oh, Aslan!\" whispered Susan in the Lion\'s ear, \"can\'t we—I mean, you won\'t, will you? Can\'t we do something about the Deep Magic? Isn\'t there something you can work against it?\"\"Work against the Emperor\'s magic?\" said Aslan turning to her with something like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again.Edmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan\'s face. He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something; but a moment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to wait, and do what he was told.\"Fall back, all of you,\" said Aslan, \"and I will talk to the Witch alone.\"They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this—waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy said, \"Oh, Edmund!\" and began to cry. Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other\'s paws with their heads bowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs. But everyone became perfectly still in the end, so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumble bee flying past, or the birds in the forest down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves. And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on.At last they heard Aslan\'s voice. \"You can all come back,\" he said. \"I have settled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother\'s blood.\" And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been holding his breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur of talk. They began to come back to Aslan\'s throne.The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face when she stopped and said,\"But how do I know this promise will be kept?\"\"Wow!\" roared Aslan half rising from his throne; and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her skirts and fairly ran for her life.');

(33, 5, 'ch14', 16, ' Chapter XIVChapter XIVThe Triumph of the WitchAs soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said, \"We must move from this place at once, it will be wanted for other purposes. We shall encamp to–night at the Fords of Beruna.\"Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters with the Witch; but his face was stern and everyone\'s ears were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared.After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill–top (for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass) they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before two o\'clock they were on the march and set off in a North–Westerly direction, walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go.During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign. \"As soon as she has finished her business in these parts,\" he said, \"the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her house and prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it.\" He then went on to outline two plans of battle—one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle. And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the operations, saying things like, \"You must put your centaurs in such and such a place\" or \"You must post scouts to see that she doesn\'t do so–and–so,\" till at last Peter said,\"But you will be there yourself, Aslan.\"\"I can give you no promise of that,\" answered the Lion. And he continued giving Peter his instructions.For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him. He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad.It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and the river was broad and shallow. This was the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water. But Peter said,\"Wouldn\'t it be better to camp on the far side—for fear she should try a night attack or anything?\"Aslan who seemed to have been thinking about something else roused himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said, \"Eh? What\'s that?\" Peter said it all over again.\"No,\" said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn\'t matter. \"No. She will not make an attack to–night.\" And then he sighed deeply. But presently he added, \"All the same it was well thought of. That is how a soldier ought to think. But it doesn\'t really matter.\" So they proceeded to pitch their camp.Aslan\'s mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own; the news that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him. Supper that evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were already drawing to their end.This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn\'t get to sleep when she went to bed. And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness.\"Can\'t you get to sleep either?\" said Susan.\"No,\" said Lucy. \"I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan?\"\"What?\"\"I\'ve a most horrible feeling—as if something were hanging over us.\"\"Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.\"\"Something about Aslan,\" said Lucy. \"Either some dreadful thing that is going to happen to him, or something dreadful that he\'s going to do.\"\"There\'s been something wrong with him all afternoon,\" said Susan. \"Lucy! What was that he said about not being with us at the battle? You don\'t think he could be stealing away and leaving us to–night, do you?\"\"Where is he now?\" said Lucy. \"Is he here in the pavilion?\"\"I don\'t think so.\"\"Susan! Let\'s go outside and have a look round. We might see him.\"\"All right. Let\'s,\" said Susan, \"we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here.\"Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers and crept out of the tent. The moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones. Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy\'s arm and said, \"Look!\" On the far side of the camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood. Without a word they both followed him.He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the left—apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet with the heavy dew. He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew. His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were very, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where there were no shadows for them to hide in, he stopped and looked round. It was no good trying to run away so they came towards him. When they were closer he said,\"Oh, children, children, why are you following me?\"\"We couldn\'t sleep,\" said Lucy—and then felt sure that she need say no more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking.\"Please, may we come with you—wherever you\'re going?\" said Susan.\"Well—\" said Aslan and seemed to be thinking. Then he said, \"I should be glad of company to–night. Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop when I tell you, and after that leave me to go on alone.\"\"Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,\" said the two girls.Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the Lion. But how slowly he walked! And his great, royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched the grass. Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan.\"Aslan! Dear Aslan!\" said Lucy, \"what is wrong? Can\'t you tell us?\"\"Are you ill, dear Aslan?\" asked Susan.\"No,\" said Aslan. \"I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that.\"And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his permission but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him—buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so doing, walked with him. And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood. They went up at the side where the trees came furthest up, and when they got to the last tree (it was one that had some bushes about it) Aslan stopped and said,\"Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do not let yourselves be seen. Farewell.\"And both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great, sad eyes. Then he turned from them and walked out onto the top of the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him and this is what they saw.A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned with evil–looking red flames and black smoke. But such people! Ogres with monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull–headed men; spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants; and other creatures whom I won\'t describe because if I did the grown–ups would probably not let you read this book—Cruels and Hags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses, and Ettins. In fact here were all those who were on the Witch\'s side and whom the Wolf had summoned at her command. And right in the middle, standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they first saw the great Lion pacing towards them, and for a moment the Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear. Then she recovered herself and gave a wild, fierce laugh.\"The fool!\" she cried. \"The fool has come. Bind him fast.\"Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan\'s roar and his spring upon his enemies. But it never came. Four hags, grinning and leering, yet also (at first) hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do, had approached him. \"Bind him, I say!\" repeated the White Witch. The hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all. Then others—evil dwarfs and apes—rushed in to help them and between them they rolled the huge Lion round on his back and tied all his four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws could have been the death of them all. But he made no noise, even when the enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tight that they cut into his flesh. Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table.\"Stop!\" said the Witch. \"Let him first be shaved.\"Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with a pair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan\'s head. Snip–snip–snip went the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground. Then the ogre stood back and the children, watching from their hiding–place, could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without its mane. The enemies also saw the difference.\"Why, he\'s only a great cat after all!\" cried one.\"Is that what we were afraid of?\" said another.And they surged round Aslan jeering at him, saying things like \"Puss, Puss! Poor Pussy,\" and \"How many mice have you caught to–day, Cat?\" and \"Would you like a saucer of milk, Pussums?\"\"Oh how can they?\" said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"The brutes, the brutes!\" for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of Aslan looked to her braver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.\"Muzzle him!\" said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his face putting on the muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or three of them their hands. But he never moved. And this seemed to enrage all that rabble. Everyone was at him now. Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage, and for a few minutes the two girls could not even see him—so thickly was he surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him, spitting on him, jeering at him.At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He was so huge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to hoist him onto the surface of it. Then there was more tying and tightening of cords.\"The cowards! The cowards!\" sobbed Susan. \"Are they still afraid of him, even now?\"When once Aslan had been tied (and tied so that he was really a mass of cords) on the flat stone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four torches, stood at the corners of the Table. The Witch bared her arms as she had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan. Then she began to whet her knife. It looked to the children, when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone not of steel and it was of a strange and evil shape.At last she drew near. She stood by Aslan\'s head. Her face was working and twitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry nor afraid, but a little sad. Then, just before she gave the blow, she stooped down and said in a quivering voice,\"And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased. But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well? And who will take him out of my hand then? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever, you have lost your own life and you have not saved his. In that knowledge, despair and die.\"The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn\'t bear to look and had covered their eyes.'),
(34, 5, 'ch15', 17, ' Chapter XVChapter XVDeeper Magic From Before the Dawn of TimeWhile the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over their faces, they heard the voice of the Witch calling out.\"Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool, the great Cat, lies dead.\"At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger. For with wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing, the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill–top and down the slope right past their hiding–place. They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping feet of the Minotaurs; and overhead there went a flurry of foul wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats. At any other time they would have trembled with fear; but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan\'s death so filled their minds that they hardly thought of it.As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out into the open hill–top. The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across her, but still they could see the shape of the great Lion lying dead in his bonds. And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur—what was left of it—and cried till they could cry no more. And then they looked at each other and held each other\'s hands for mere loneliness and cried again; and then again were silent. At last Lucy said,\"I can\'t bear the look of that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take it off?\"So they tried. And after a lot of working at it (for their fingers were cold and it was now the darkest part of the night) they succeeded. And when they saw his face without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could. And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe.\"I wonder could we untie him as well?\" said Susan presently. But the enemies, out of pure spitefulness had drawn the cords so tight that the girls could make nothing of the knots.I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy were that night; but if you have been—if you\'ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you—you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going to happen again. At any rate that was how it felt to these two. Hours and hours seemed to go by in this dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder. But at last Lucy noticed two other things. One was that the sky on the East side of the hill was a little less dark than it had been an hour ago. The other was some tiny movement going on in the grass at her feet. At first she took no interest in this. What did it matter? Nothing mattered now! But at last she saw that whatever–it–was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table. And now whatever–they–were were moving about on Aslan\'s body. She peered closer. They were little grey things.\"Ugh!\" said Susan from the other side of the Table. \"How beastly! There are horrid little mice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts.\" And she raised her hand to frighten them away.\"Wait!\" said Lucy who had been looking at them more closely still. \"Can you see what they\'re doing?\"Both girls bent down and stared.\"I do believe!\" said Susan. \"But how queer. They\'re nibbling away at the cords!\"\"That\'s what I thought,\" said Lucy. \"I think they\'re friendly mice. Poor little things—they don\'t realise he\'s dead. They think it\'ll do some good untying him.\"It was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the first time the white face of the other. They could see the mice nibbling away; dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of little field mice. And at last, one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.The sky in the East was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter—all except one very big one low down on the Eastern horizon. They felt colder than they had been all night. The mice crept away again.The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked more like himself without them. Every moment his dead face looked nobler, as the light grew and they could see it better.In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so still for hours and hours that it startled them. Then another bird answered it. Soon there were birds singing all over the place.It was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.\"I\'m so cold,\" said Lucy.\"So am I,\" said Susan. \"Let\'s walk about a bit.\"They walked to the Eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one big star had almost disappeared. The country all looked dark grey, but beyond, at the very end of the world, the sea showed pale. The sky began to turn red. They walked to and fro more times than they could count between the dead Aslan and the Eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; and oh, how tired their legs felt. Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out towards the sea and Cair Paravel (which they could now just make out) the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun. At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise—a great cracking, deafening noise as if a giant had broken a giant\'s plate.\"What\'s that?\" said Lucy, clutching Susan\'s arm.\"I—I feel afraid to turn round,\" said Susan; \"something awful is happening.\"\"They\'re doing something worse to him,\" said Lucy. \"Come on!\" And she turned, pulling Susan round with her.The rising of the sun had made everything look so different—all the colours and shadows were changed—that for a moment they didn\'t see the important thing. Then they did. The Stone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.\"Oh, oh, oh!\" cried the two girls rushing back to the Table.\"Oh, it\'s too bad,\" sobbed Lucy; \"they might have left the body alone.\"\"Who\'s done it?\" cried Susan. \"What does it mean? Is it more magic?\"\"Yes!\" said a great voice behind their backs. \"It is more magic.\" They looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\"Oh, Aslan!\" cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as much frightened as they were glad.\"Aren\'t you dead then, dear Aslan?\" said Lucy.\"Not now,\" said Aslan.\"You\'re not—not a—?\" asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn\'t bring herself to say the word ghost.Aslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead. The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her.\"Do I look it?\" he said.\"Oh, you\'re real, you\'re real! Oh, Aslan!\" cried Lucy and both girls flung themselves upon him and covered him with kisses.\"But what does it all mean?\" asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer.\"It means,\" said Aslan, \"that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor\'s stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards. And now—\"Oh yes. Now?\" said Lucy jumping up and clapping her hands.\"Oh, children,\" said the Lion, \"I feel my strength coming back to me. Oh, children, catch me if you can!\" He stood for a second, his eyes very bright, his limbs quivering, lashing himself with his tail. Then he made a leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table. Laughing, though she didn\'t know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach him. Aslan leaped again. A mad chase began. Round and round the hill–top he led them, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them almost catch his tail, now diving between them, now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paws and catching them again, and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It was such a romp as no one has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was more like playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind. And the funny thing was that when all three finally lay together panting in the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.\"And now,\" said Aslan presently, \"to business. I feel I am going to roar. You had better put your fingers in your ears.\"And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it. And they saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in a meadow before the wind. Then he said,\"We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.\" And he crouched down and the children climbed onto his warm, golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan. And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off, faster than any horse could go, downhill and into the thick of the forest.That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the harness and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying back in the wind. And then imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this is a mount that doesn\'t need to be guided and never grows tired. He rushes on and on, never missing his footing, never hesitating, threading his way with perfect skill between tree–trunks, jumping over bush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all. And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs but right across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny glades of oak, through wild orchards of snow–white cherry trees, past roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight with gorse bushes and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blue flowers.It was nearly mid–day when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle—a little toy castle it looked from where they stood—which seemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a level with it. And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them. No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut. And Aslan, not at all slacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet towards it.\"The Witch\'s home!\" he cried. \"Now, children, hold tight.\"Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the children felt as if they had left their insides behind them; for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped—or you may call it flying rather than jumping—right over the castle wall. The two girls, breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues.'),
(35, 5, 'ch16', 18, ' Chapter XVIChapter XVIWhat Happened About the Statues\"What an extraordinary place!\" cried Lucy. \"All those stone animals—and people too! It\'s—it\'s like a museum.\"\"Hush,\" said Susan, \"Aslan\'s doing something.\"He was indeed. He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him. Then without waiting a moment he whisked round—almost as if he had been a cat chasing its tail—and breathed also on the stone dwarf, which (as you remember) was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it. Then he pounced on a tall stone Dryad which stood beyond the dwarf, turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right, and rushed on to two centaurs. But at that moment Lucy said,\"Oh, Susan! Look! Look at the lion.\"I expect you\'ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire. And for a second nothing seems to have happened; and then you notice a tiny streak of flame creeping along the edge of the newspaper. It was like that now. For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same. Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back—then it spread—then the colour seemed to lick all over him as the flame licks all over a bit of paper—then, while his hind–quarters were still obviously stone the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stony folds rippled into living hair. Then he opened a great red mouth, warm and living, and gave a prodigious yawn. And now his hind legs had come to life. He lifted one of them and scratched himself. Then, having caught sight of Aslan, he went bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his face.Of course the children\'s eyes turned to follow the lion; but the sight they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him. Everywhere the statues were coming to life. The courtyard looked no longer like a museum; it looked more like a zoo. Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he was almost hidden in the crowd. Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard was now a blaze of colours; glossy chestnut sides of centaurs, indigo horns of unicorns, dazzling plumage of birds, reddy–brown of foxes, dogs, and satyrs, yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs; and the birch–girls in silver, and the beech–girls in fresh, transparent green, and the larch–girls in green so bright that it was almost yellow. And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roarings, brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings, cooings, neighings, stampings, shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.\"Ooh!\" said Susan in a different tone. \"Look! I wonder—I mean, is it safe?\"Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stone giant.\"It\'s all right!\" shouted Aslan joyously. \"Once the feet are put right, all the rest of him will follow.\"\"That wasn\'t exactly what I meant,\" whispered Susan to Lucy. But it was too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her. The change was already creeping up the Giant\'s legs. Now he was moving his feet. A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder, rubbed his eyes and said,\"Bless me! I must have been asleep. Now! Where\'s that dratted little Witch that was running about on the ground. Somewhere just by my feet it was.\" But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened, and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again so that at last he understood, then he bowed down till his head was no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan, beaming all over his honest ugly face, (giants of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming. It\'s a sight well worth looking at.)\"Now for the inside of this house!\" said Aslan. \"Look alive, everyone. Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady\'s chamber! Leave no corner unsearched. You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed.\"And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole of that dark, horrible, fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows and with everyone\'s voices crying out at once \"Don\'t forget the dungeons—Give us a hand with this door!—Here\'s another little winding stair—Oh! I say. Here\'s a poor little kangaroo. Call Aslan—Phew! How it smells in here—Look out for trap–doors—Up here! There are a whole lot more on the landing!\" But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out,\"Aslan! Aslan! I\'ve found Mr. Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.\"A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding one another by both hands and dancing round and round for joy. The little chap was none the worse for having been a statue and was of course very interested in all she had to tell him.But at last the ransacking of the Witch\'s fortress was ended. The whole castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil places which needed them so badly. The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the courtyard. And it was then that someone (Tumnus, I think) first said,\"But how are we going to get out?\" for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gates were still locked.\"That\'ll be all right,\" said Aslan; and then, rising on his hind–legs, he bawled up at the Giant. \"Hi! You up there,\" he roared. \"What\'s your name?\"\"Giant Rumblebuffin if it please your honour,\" said the Giant, once more touching his cap.\"Well then, Giant Rumblebuffin,\" said Aslan, \"just let us out of this, will you?\"\"Certainly, your honour. It will be a pleasure,\" said Giant Rumblebuffin. \"Stand well away from the gates, all you little \'uns.\" Then he strode to the gate himself and bang—bang—bang—went his huge club. The gates creaked at the first blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third. Then he tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of crashing and thudding both the towers and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble; and when the dust cleared it was odd, standing in that dry, grim, stony yard, to see through the gap all the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest, and the blue hills beyond that and beyond them the sky.\"Blowed if I ain\'t all in a muck sweat,\" said the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine. \"Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket–handkerchee about you?\"\"Yes, I have,\" said Lucy standing on tip–toes and holding her handkerchief up as far as she could reach.\"Thank you, Missie,\" said Giant Rumblebuffin stooping down. Next moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid–air between the Giant\'s finger and thumb. But just as she was getting near his face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering, \"Bless me! I\'ve picked up the little girl instead. I beg your pardon, Missie, I thought you was the handkerchee!\"\"No, no,\" said Lucy laughing, \"here it is!\" This time he managed to get it but it was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you, so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great red face, she said, \"I\'m afraid it\'s not much use to you, Mr. Rumblebuffin.\"\"Not at all. Not at all,\" said the Giant politely. \"Never met a nicer handkerchee. So fine, so handy. So—I don\'t know how to describe it.\"\"What a nice giant he is!\" said Lucy to Mr. Tumnus.\"Oh yes,\" replied the Faun. \"All the Buffins always were. One of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia. Not very clever, perhaps (I never knew a giant that was) but an old family. With traditions, you know. If he\'d been the other sort she\'d never have turned him into stone.\"At this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence.\"Our day\'s work is not yet over,\" he said, \"and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed–time we must find the battle at once.\"\"And join in I hope, Sir!\" added the largest of the centaurs.\"Of course,\" said Aslan. \"And now! Those who can\'t keep up—that is, children, dwarfs, and small animals—must ride on the backs of those who can—that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants and eagles. Those who are good with their noses must come in the front with us lions to smell out where the battle is. Look lively and sort yourselves.\"And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased of the lot was the other lion, who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met, \"Did you hear what he said? Us lions. That means him and me. Us lions. That\'s what I like about Aslan. No side, no stand–off–ishness. Us lions. That meant him and me.\" At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs, one Dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog. That steadied him a bit.When all were ready (it was a big sheep–dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted into their proper order) they set out through the gap in the castle wall. At first the lions and dogs went nosing about in all directions. But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay. There was no time lost after that. Soon all the dogs and lions and wolves and other hunting animals were going at full speed with their noses to the ground, and all the others, streaked out for about half a mile behind them, were following as fast as they could. The noise was like an English fox–hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself. Faster and faster they went as the scent became easier and easier to follow. And then, just as they came to the last curve in a narrow, winding valley, Lucy heard above all these noises another noise—a different one, which gave her a queer feeling inside. It was a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal.Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason. There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan\'s army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had seen last night; only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed. There also seemed to be far more of them. Aslan\'s army—which had their backs to her—looked terribly few. And there were statues dotted all over the battlefield, so apparently the Witch had been using her wand. But she did not seem to be using it now. She was fighting with her stone knife. It was Peter she was fighting—both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what was happening; she only saw the stone knife and Peter\'s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like three knives and three swords. That pair were in the centre. On each side the line stretched out. Horrible things were happening wherever she looked.\"Off my back, children,\" shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off. Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the Western lamp–post to the shores of the Eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch. Lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement. Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath; and at the same moment all war–like creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch\'s house rushed madly on the enemy\'s line, dwarfs with their battle–axes, dogs with teeth, the giant with his club (and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe) unicorns with their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs. And Peter\'s tired army cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the wood re–echoed with the din of that onset.'),
(36, 5, 'ch17', 19, ' Chapter XVIIChapter XVIIThe Hunting of the White StagThe battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival. Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his companions; and when those who were still living saw that the Witch was dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight. The next thing that Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands. It was strange to her to see Peter looking as he looked now—his face was so pale and stern and he seemed so much older.\"It was all Edmund\'s doing, Aslan,\" Peter was saying. \"We\'d have been beaten if it hadn\'t been for him. The Witch was–turning our troops into stone right and left. But nothing would stop him. He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue. And when he reached her he had the sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pains. That was the mistake all the rest were making. Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance—if we hadn\'t lost so many already. He was terribly wounded. We must go and see him.\"They found Edmund in charge of Mrs. Beaver a little way back from the fighting line. He was covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face a nasty green colour.\"Quick, Lucy,\" said Aslan.And then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled so much that she could hardly undo the stopper, but she managed it in the end and poured a few drops into her brother\'s mouth.\"There are other people wounded,\" said Aslan while she was still looking eagerly into Edmund\'s pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result.\"Yes, I know,\" said Lucy crossly. \"Wait a minute.\"\"Daughter of Eve,\" said Aslan in a graver voice, \"others also are at the point of death. Must more people die for Edmund?\"\"I\'m sorry, Aslan,\" said Lucy getting up and going with him. And for the next half hour they were busy—she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had been turned into stone. When at last she was free to come back to Edmund she found him standing on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look—oh, for ages; in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong. He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a Knight.\"Does he know,\" whispered Lucy to Susan, \"what Aslan did for him? Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was?\"\"Hush! No. Of course not,\" said Susan.\"Oughtn\'t he to be told?\" said Lucy.\"Oh, surely not,\" said Susan. \"It would be too awful for him. Think how you\'d feel if you were he.\"\"All the same I think he ought to know,\" said Lucy. But at that moment they were interrupted.That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for them all I don\'t know; but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o\'clock. Next day they began marching Eastward down the side of the great river. And the next day after that, at about tea–time, they actually reached the mouth. The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them; before them were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and sea weed, and the smell of the sea, and long miles of bluish–green waves breaking forever and ever on the beach. And, oh, the cry of the sea gulls! Have you heard it? Can you remember?That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beach again and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes. But next day was more solemn. For then, in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel—that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west door all hung with peacock\'s feathers and the eastern door which opens right onto the sea, in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them onto the four thrones amid deafening shouts of, \"Long Live King Peter! Long Live Queen Susan! Long Live King Edmund! Long Live Queen Lucy!\"\"Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!\" said Aslan.And through the Eastern door, which was wide open came the voices of the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the castle steps and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens.So the children sat in their thrones and sceptres were put into their hands and they gave rewards and honours to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the good centaurs and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed and wine flowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter, and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.But amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn\'t there they said nothing about it. For Mr. Beaver had warned them, \"He\'ll be coming and going\" he had said. \"One day you\'ll see him and another you won\'t. He doesn\'t like being tied down—and of course he has other countries to attend to. It\'s quite all right. He\'ll often drop in. Only you mustn\'t press him. He\'s wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\"And now, as you see, this story is nearly (but not quite) at an end. These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well and long and happy was their reign. At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the remnants of the White Witch\'s army and destroying them, and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest—a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next. But in the end all that foul brood was stamped out. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to school, and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live. And they drove back the fierce giants (quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin) on the North of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier. And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over them. And Peter became a tall and deep chested man and a great warrior, and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the Kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage. And she was called Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgement. He was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden haired, and all Princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it was only as one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that Tumnus (who was a middle–aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout) came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in his parts—the White Stag who would give you wishes if you caught him. So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal members of their court, rode a–hunting with horns and hounds in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag. And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him. And he led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin, till the horses of all the courtiers were tired out and only these four were still following. And they saw the stag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said King Peter (for they talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings and Queens for so long) \"Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry.\"\"Sir,\" said the others, \"even so let us do.\"So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick wood on foot. And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,\"Fair friends, here is a great marvel, for I seem to see a tree of iron.\"\"Madam,\" said King Edmund, \"if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof.\"\"Marry, a strange device,\" said King Peter, \"to set a lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man!\"\"Sir,\" said Queen Lucy. \"By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For this is a young wood and the iron post is old.\" And they stood looking upon it. Then said King Edmund,\"I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely. It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before; as it were in a dream, or in the dream of a dream.\"\"Sir,\" answered they all, \"it is even so with us also.\"\"And more,\" said Queen Lucy, \"for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern, either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes.\"\"Madam,\" said King Edmund, \"the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also.\"\"And in mine, fair brother,\" said King Peter.\"And in mine too,\" said Queen Susan. \"Wherefore by my council we shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further.\"\"Madam,\" said King Peter, \"therein I pray thee to have me excused. For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter, as battles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice, and the like, and then given over; but always what we have taken in hand, the same we have achieved.\"\"Sister,\" said Queen Lucy, \"my royal brother speaks rightly. And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase.\"\"And so say I,\" said King Edmund. \"And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.\"\"Then in the name of Aslan,\" said Queen Susan, \"if ye will all have it so, let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us.\"So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had gone a score of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamp–post, and before they had gone twenty more, they noticed that they were making their way not through branches but through coats. And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room, and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide. Mrs. Macready and the visitors were still talking in the passage; but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the children weren\'t caught.And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn\'t been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his wardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very remarkable man, didn\'t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but believed the whole story. \"No,\" he said, \"I don\'t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats. You won\'t get into Narnia again by that route. Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did! Eh? What\'s that? Yes, of course you\'ll get back to Narnia again some day. Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don\'t go trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don\'t try to get there at all. It\'ll happen when you\'re not looking for it. And don\'t talk too much about it even among yourselves. And don\'t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they\'ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What\'s that? How will you know? Oh, you\'ll know all right. Odd things, they say—even their looks—will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools?\"And that is the very end of the adventures of the wardrobe. But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.

(39, 6, 'ch01', 3, ' 11A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan mountains, but on the valley side the water is lined with trees—willows fresh and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winter’s flooding; and sycamores with mottled, white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool. On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them. Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of ’coons, and with the spread pads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split–wedge tracks of deer that come to drink in the dark.There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungle–up near water. In front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it.* * * * *Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the leaves. The shade climbed up the hills toward the top. On the sand banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray, sculptured stones. And then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried noiselessly for cover. A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down river. For a moment the place was lifeless, and then two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green pool.They had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open one stayed behind the other. Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.The first man stopped short in the clearing, and the follower nearly ran over him. He took off his hat and wiped the sweat–band with his forefinger and snapped the moisture off. His huge companion dropped his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of the green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into the water like a horse. The small man stepped nervously beside him.“Lennie!” he said sharply. “Lennie, for God’ sakes don’t drink so much.” Lennie continued to snort into the pool. The small man leaned over and shook him by the shoulder. “Lennie. You gonna be sick like you was last night.”Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back. “Tha’s good,” he said. “You drink some, George. You take a good big drink.” He smiled happily.George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank. “I ain’t sure it’s good water,” he said. “Looks kinda scummy.”Lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. “Look, George. Look what I done.”George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick scoops. “Tastes all right,” he admitted. “Don’t really seem to be running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t running, Lennie,” he said hopelessly. “You’d drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty.” He threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.George stared morosely at the water. The rims of his eyes were red with sun glare. He said angrily, “We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin’ about. ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the highway,’ he says. ‘Jes’ a little stretch.’ God damn near four miles, that’s what it was! Didn’t wanta stop at the ranch gate, that’s what. Too God damn lazy to pull up. Wonder he isn’t too damn good to stop in Soledad at all. Kicks us out and says, ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the road.’ I bet it was more than four miles. Damn hot day.”Lennie looked timidly over to him. “George?”“Yeah, what ya want?”“Where we goin’, George?”The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over at Lennie. “So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!”“I forgot,” Lennie said softly. “I tried not to forget. Honest to God I did, George.”“O.K.—O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got nothing to do. Might jus’ as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you things and then you forget ’em, and I tell you again.” “Tried and tried,” said Lennie, “but it didn’t do no good. I remember about the rabbits, George.”“The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever can remember is them rabbits. O.K.! Now you listen and this time you got to remember so we don’t get in no trouble. You remember settin’ in that gutter on Howard street and watchin’ that blackboard?”Lennie’s face broke into a delighted smile. “Why sure, George, I remember that … but … what’d we do then? I remember some girls come by and you says … you say … ”“The hell with what I says. You remember about us goin’ into Murray and Ready’s, and they give us work cards and bus tickets?”“Oh, sure, George. I remember that now.” His hands went quickly into his side coat pockets. He said gently, “George … I ain’t got mine. I musta lost it.” He looked down at the ground in despair.“You never had none, you crazy bastard. I got both of ’em here. Think I’d let you carry your own work card?”Lennie grinned with relief. “I … I thought I put it in my side pocket.” His hand went into the pocket again.George looked sharply at him. “What’d you take outa that pocket?”“Ain’t a thing in my pocket,” Lennie said cleverly.“I know there ain’t. You got it in your hand. What you got in your hand—hidin’ it?”“I ain’t got nothin’, George. Honest.”“Come on, give it here.”Lennie held his closed hand away from George’s direction. “It’s on’y a mouse, George.”“A mouse? A live mouse?”“Uh–uh. Jus’ a dead mouse, George. I didn’ kill it. Honest! I found it. I found it dead.”“Give it here!” said George.“Aw, leave me have it, George.”“Give it here!”Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. “What you want of a dead mouse, anyways?”“I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along,” said Lennie.“Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me. You remember where we’re goin’ now?”Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face against his knees. “I forgot again.”“Jesus Christ,” George said resignedly. “Well—look, we’re gonna work on a ranch like the one we come from up north.”“Up north?”“In Weed.”“Oh, sure. I remember. In Weed.”“That ranch we’re goin’ to is right down there about a quarter mile. We’re gonna go in an’ see the boss. Now, look—I’ll give him the work tickets, but you ain’t gonna say a word. You jus’ stand there and don’t say nothing. If he finds out what a crazy bastard you are, we won’t get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk, we’re set. Ya got that?”“Sure, George. Sure I got it.”“O.K. Now when we go in to see the boss, what you gonna do?”“I … I,” Lennie thought. His face grew tight with thought. “I … ain’t gonna say nothin’. Jus’ gonna stan’ there.”“Good boy. That’s swell. You say that over two, three times so you sure won’t forget it.”Lennie droned to himself softly, “I ain’t gonna say nothin’ … I ain’t gonna say nothin’ … I ain’t gonna say nothin’.”“O.K.,” said George. “An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you done in Weed, neither.”Lennie looked puzzled. “Like I done in Weed?”“Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya? Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, fear ya do it again.”A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. “They run us outa Weed,” he exploded triumphantly.“Run us out, hell,” said George disgustedly. “We run. They was lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch us.”Lennie giggled happily. “I didn’t forget that, you bet.”George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he were doing it right. “God, you’re a lot of trouble,” said George. “I could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I could live so easy and maybe have a girl.”For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, “We gonna work on a ranch, George.”“Awright. You got that. But we’re gonna sleep here because I got a reason.”The day was going fast now. Only the tops of the Gabilan mountains flamed with the light of the sun that had gone from the valley. A water snake slipped along on the pool, its head held up like a little periscope. The reeds jerked slightly in the current. Far off toward the highway a man shouted something, and another man shouted back. The sycamore limbs rustled under a little wind that died immediately.“George—why ain’t we goin’ on to the ranch and get some supper? They got supper at the ranch.”George rolled on his side. “No reason at all for you. I like it here. Tomorra we’re gonna go to work. I seen thrashin’ machines on the way down. That means we’ll be bucking grain bags, bustin’ a gut. Tonight I’m gonna lay right here and look up. I like it.”Lennie got up on his knees and looked down at George. “Ain’t we gonna have no supper?”“Sure we are, if you gather up some dead willow sticks. I got three can of beans in my bindle. You get a fire ready. I’ll give you a match when you get the sticks together. Then we’ll heat the beans and have supper.”Lennie said, “I like beans with ketchup.”“Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An’ don’t you fool around. It’ll be dark before long.”Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped whistling and listened. “Poor bastard,” he said softly, and then went on whistling again.In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up. “Awright,” he said brusquely. “Gi’me that mouse!”But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. “What mouse, George? I ain’t got no mouse.”George held out his hand. “Come on. Give it to me. You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.”Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said coldly, “You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?”“Give you what, George?”“You know God damn well what. I want that mouse.”Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a little. “I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road.”George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a ball to its master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.“I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ strokin’ it.”George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush, and then he stepped to the pool and washed his hands. “You crazy fool. Don’t you think I could see your feet was wet where you went acrost the river to get it?” He heard Lennie’s whimpering cry and wheeled about. “Blubberin’ like a baby! Jesus Christ! A big guy like you.” Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. “Aw, Lennie!” George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. “I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for meanness. That mouse ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a little while.”Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. “I don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give ’em to me—ever’ one she got. But that lady ain’t here.”George scoffed. “Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ ’em to ya. You always killed em.”Lennie looked sadly up at him. “They was so little,” he said, apologetically. “I’d pet ’em, and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead—because they was so little.”“I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain’t so little.”“The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live mice. Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t have nothing to do with it.”“It wasn’t no good to pet,” said Lennie.The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain–tops and dusk came into the valley, and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores. A big carp rose to the surface of the pool, gulped air and then sank mysteriously into the dark water again, leaving widening rings on the water. Overhead the leaves whisked again and little puffs of willow cotton blew down and landed on the pool’s surface.“You gonna get that wood?” George demanded. “There’s plenty right up against the back of that sycamore. Floodwater wood. Now you get it.”Lennie went behind the tree and brought out a litter of dried leaves and twigs. He threw them in a heap on the old ash pile and went back for more and more. It was almost night now. A dove’s wings whistled over the water. George walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves. The flame cracked up among the twigs and fell to work. George undid his bindle and brought out three cans of beans. He stood them about the fire, close in against the blaze, but not quite touching the flame.“There’s enough beans for four men,” George said.Lennie watched him from over the fire. He said patiently, “I like ’em with ketchup.”“Well, we ain’t got any,” George exploded. “Whatever we ain’t got, that’s what you want. God a’mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job an’ work, an’ no trouble. No mess at all, and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I want. Why, I could stay in a cat house all night. I could eat any place I want, hotel or any place, and order any damn thing I could think of. An’ I could do all that every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool.” Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. “An’ whatta I got,” George went on furiously. “I got you! You can’t keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the worst. You get in trouble. You do bad things and I got to get you out.” His voice rose nearly to a shout. “You crazy son–of–a–bitch. You keep me in hot water all the time.” He took on the elaborate manner of little girls when they are mimicking one another. “Jus’ wanted to feel that girl’s dress—jus’ wanted to pet it like it was a mouse—— Well, how the hell did she know you jus’ wanted to feel her dress? She jerks back and you hold on like it was a mouse. She yells and we got to hide in a irrigation ditch all day with guys lookin’ for us, and we got to sneak out in the dark and get outta the country. All the time somethin’ like that—all the time. I wisht I could put you in a cage with about a million mice an’ let you have fun.” His anger left him suddenly. He looked across the fire at Lennie’s anguished face, and then he looked ashamedly at the flames.It was quite dark now, but the fire lighted the trunks of the trees and the curving branches overhead. Lennie crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until he was close to George. He sat back on his heels. George turned the bean cans so that another side faced the fire. He pretended to be unaware of Lennie so close beside him.“George,” very softly. No answer. “George!”“Whatta you want?”“I was only foolin’, George. I don’t want no ketchup. I wouldn’t eat no ketchup if it was right here beside me.”“If it was here, you could have some.”“But I wouldn’t eat none, George. I’d leave it all for you. You could cover your beans with it and I wouldn’t touch none of it.”George still stared morosely at the fire. “When I think of the swell time I could have without you, I go nuts. I never get no peace.”Lennie still knelt. He looked off into the darkness across the river. “George, you want I should go away and leave you alone?”“Where the hell could you go?”“Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some place I’d find a cave.”“Yeah? How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense enough to find nothing to eat.”“I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice food with ketchup. I’d lay out in the sun and nobody’d hurt me. An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me.”George looked quickly and searchingly at him. “I been mean, ain’t I?”“If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can go away any time.”“No—look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause I want you to stay with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em.” He paused. “Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I’ll give you a pup. Maybe you wouldn’t kill it. That’d be better than mice. And you could pet it harder.”Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage. “If you don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those hills right there—right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I won’t get no mice stole from me.”George said, “I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you stay with me. Your Aunt Clara wouldn’t like you running off by yourself, even if she is dead.”Lennie spoke craftily, “Tell me—like you done before.”“Tell you what?”“About the rabbits.”George snapped, “You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me.”Lennie pleaded, “Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like you done before.”“You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and then we’ll eat our supper….”George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his words rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. “Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look ahead to.”Lennie was delighted. “That’s it—that’s it. Now tell how it is with us.”George went on. “With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to sit in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.”Lennie broke in. “But not us! An’ why? Because … because I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that’s why.” He laughed delightedly. “Go on now, George!”“You got it by heart. You can do it yourself.”“No, you. I forget some a’ the things. Tell about how it’s gonna be.”“O.K. Someday—we’re gonna get the jack together and we’re gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an’ a cow and some pigs and——”“An’ live off the fatta the lan’,” Lennie shouted. “An’ have rabbits. Go on, George! Tell about what we’re gonna have in the garden and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is on the milk like you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George.”“Why’n’t you do it yourself? You know all of it.”“No … you tell it. It ain’t the same if I tell it. Go on … George. How I get to tend the rabbits.”“Well,” said George, “we’ll have a big vegetable patch and a rabbit hutch and chickens. And when it rains in the winter, we’ll just say the hell with goin’ to work, and we’ll build up a fire in the stove and set around it an’ listen to the rain comin’ down on the roof—Nuts!” He took out his pocket knife. “I ain’t got time for no more.” He drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans, sawed out the top and passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed one of them to Lennie.They sat by the fire and filled their mouths with beans and chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out of the side of Lennie’s mouth. George gestured with his spoon. “What you gonna say tomorrow when the boss asks you questions?”Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His face was concentrated. “I …I ain’t gonna … say a word.”“Good boy! That’s fine, Lennie! Maybe you’re gettin’ better. When we get the coupla acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right. ’Specially if you remember as good as that.”Lennie choked with pride. “I can remember,” he said.George motioned with his spoon again. “Look, Lennie. I want you to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?”“Sure,” said Lennie. “I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember about not gonna say a word?”“’Course you did. Well, look. Lennie—if you jus’ happen to get in trouble like you always done before, I want you to come right here an’ hide in the brush.”“Hide in the brush,” said Lennie slowly.“Hide in the brush till I come for you. Can you remember that?”“Sure I can, George. Hide in the brush till you come.”“But you ain’t gonna get in no trouble, because if you do, I won’t let you tend the rabbits.” He threw his empty bean can off into the brush.“I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t gonna say a word.”“O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It’s gonna be nice sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, and the leaves. Don’t build up no more fire. We’ll let her die down.”They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze dropped from the fire the sphere of light grew smaller; the curling branches disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, “George—you asleep?”“No. Whatta you want?”“Let’s have different color rabbits, George.”“Sure we will,” George said sleepily. “Red and blue and green rabbits, Lennie. Millions of ’em.”“Furry ones, George, like I seen in the fair in Sacramento.”“Sure, furry ones.”“’Cause I can jus’ as well go away, George, an’ live in a cave.”“You can jus’ as well go to hell,” said George. “Shut up now.”The red light dimmed on the coals. Up the hill from the river a coyote yammered, and a dog answered from the other side of the stream. The sycamore leaves whispered in a little night breeze.');

(40, 6, 'ch02', 4, ' 22The bunk house was a long, rectangular building. Inside, the walls were whitewashed and the floor unpainted. In three walls there were small, square windows, and in the fourth, a solid door with a wooden latch. Against the walls were eight bunks, five of them made up with blankets and the other three showing their burlap ticking. Over each bunk there was nailed an apple box with the opening forward so that it made two shelves for the personal belongings of the occupant of the bunk. And these shelves were loaded with little articles, soap and talcum powder, razors and those Western magazines ranch men love to read and scoff at and secretly believe. And there were medicines on the shelves, and little vials, combs; and from nails on the box sides, a few neckties. Near one wall there was a black cast–iron stove, its stovepipe going straight up through the ceiling. In the middle of the room stood a big square table littered with playing cards, and around it were grouped boxes for the players to sit on.At about ten o’clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust–laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.The wooden latch raised. The door opened and a tall, stoop–shouldered old man came in. He was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a big push–broom in his left hand. Behind him came George, and behind George, Lennie.“The boss was expectin’ you last night,” the old man said. “He was sore as hell when you wasn’t here to go out this morning.” He pointed with his right arm, and out of the sleeve came a round stick–like wrist, but no hand. “You can have them two beds there,” he said, indicating two bunks near the stove.George stepped over and threw his blankets down on the burlap sack of straw that was a mattress. He looked into his box shelf and then picked a small yellow can from it. “Say. What the hell’s this?”“I don’t know,” said the old man.“Says ‘positively kills lice, roaches and other scourges.’ What the hell kind of bed you giving us, anyways. We don’t want no pants rabbits.”The old swamper shifted his broom and held it between his elbow and his side while he held out his hand for the can. He studied the label carefully. “Tell you what—” he said finally, “last guy that had this bed was a blacksmith—hell of a nice fella and as clean a guy as you want to meet. Used to wash his hands even after he ate.”“Then how come he got graybacks?” George was working up a slow anger. Lennie put his bindle on the neighboring bunk and sat down. He watched George with open mouth.“Tell you what,” said the old swamper. “This here blacksmith—name of Whitey—was the kind of guy that would put that stuff around even if there wasn’t no bugs—just to make sure, see? Tell you what he used to do—At meals he’d peel his boil’ potatoes, an’ he’d take out ever’ little spot, no matter what kind, before he’d eat it. And if there was a red splotch on an egg, he’d scrape it off. Finally quit about the food. That’s the kinda guy he was—clean. Used ta dress up Sundays even when he wasn’t going no place, put on a necktie even, and then set in the bunk house.”“I ain’t so sure,” said George skeptically. “What did you say he quit for?”The old man put the yellow can in his pocket, and he rubbed his bristly white whiskers with his knuckles. “Why … he … just quit, the way a guy will. Says it was the food. Just wanted to move. Didn’t give no other reason but the food. Just says ‘gimme my time’ one night, the way any guy would.”George lifted his tick and looked underneath it. He leaned over and inspected the sacking closely. Immediately Lennie got up and did the same with his bed. Finally George seemed satisfied. He unrolled his bindle and put things on the shelf, his razor and bar of soap, his comb and bottle of pills, his liniment and leather wristband. Then he made his bed up neatly with blankets. The old man said, “I guess the boss’ll be out here in a minute. He was sure burned when you wasn’t here this morning. Come right in when we was eatin’ breakfast and says, ‘Where the hell’s them new men?’ An’ he give the stable buck hell, too.”George patted a wrinkle out of his bed, and sat down. “Give the stable buck hell?” he asked.“Sure. Ya see the stable buck’s a nigger.”“Nigger, huh?”“Yeah. Nice fella too. Got a crooked back where a horse kicked him. The boss gives him hell when he’s mad. But the stable buck don’t give a damn about that. He reads a lot. Got books in his room.”“What kind of a guy is the boss?” George asked.“Well, he’s a pretty nice fella. Gets pretty mad sometimes, but he’s pretty nice. Tell ya what—know what he done Christmas? Brang a gallon of whisky right in here and says, ‘Drink hearty boys. Christmas comes but once a year.’”“The hell he did! Whole gallon?”“Yes sir. Jesus, we had fun. They let the nigger come in that night. Little skinner name of Smitty took after the nigger. Done pretty good, too. The guys wouldn’t let him use his feet, so the nigger got him. If he coulda used his feet, Smitty says he woulda kilted the nigger. The guys said on account of the nigger’s got a crooked back, Smitty can’t use his feet.” He paused in relish of the memory. “After that the guys went into Soledad and raised hell. I didn’t go in there. I ain’t got the poop no more.”Lennie was just finishing making his bed. The wooden latch raised again and the door opened. A little stocky man stood in the open doorway. He wore blue jean trousers, a flannel shirt, a black, unbuttoned vest and a black coat. His thumbs were stuck in his belt, on each side of a square steel buckle. On his head was a soiled brown Stetson hat, and he wore high–heeled boots and spurs to prove he was not a laboring man.The old swamper looked quickly at him, and then shuffled to the door rubbing his whiskers with his knuckles as he went, “Them guys just come,” he said, and shuffled past the boss and out the door.The boss stepped into the room with the short, quick steps of a fat–legged man. “I wrote Murray and Ready I wanted two men this morning. You got your work slips?” George reached into his pocket and produced the slips and handed them to the boss. “It wasn’t Murray and Ready’s fault. Says right here on the slip that you was to be here for work this morning.”George looked down at his feet. “Bus driver give us a bum steer,” he said. “We hadda walk ten miles. Says we was here when we wasn’t. We couldn’t get no rides in the morning.”The boss squinted his eyes. “Well, I had to send out the grain teams short two buckers. Won’t do any good to go out now till after dinner.” He pulled his time book out of his pocket and opened it where a pencil was stuck between the leaves. George scowled meaningfully at Lennie, and Lennie nodded to show that he understood. The boss licked his pencil. “What’s your name?”“George Milton.”“And what’s yours?”George said, “His name’s Lennie Small.”The names were entered in the book. “Le’s see, this is the twentieth, noon the twentieth.” He closed the book. “Where you boys been working?”“Up around Weed,” said George.“You, too?” to Lennie.“Yeah, him too,” said George.The boss pointed a playful finger at Lennie. “He ain’t much of a talker, is he?”“No, he ain’t, but he’s sure a hell of a good worker. Strong as a bull.”Lennie smiled to himself. “Strong as a bull,” he repeated.George scowled at him, and Lennie dropped his head in shame at having forgotten.The boss said suddenly, “Listen, Small!” Lennie raised his head. “What can you do?”In a panic, Lennie looked at George for help. “He can do anything you tell him,” said George. “He’s a good skinner. He can rassel grain bags, drive a cultivator. He can do anything. Just give him a try.”The boss turned on George. “Then why don’t you let him answer? What you trying to put over?”George broke in loudly, “Oh! I ain’t saying he’s bright. He ain’t. But I say he’s a God damn good worker. He can put up a four hundred pound bale.”The boss deliberately put the little book in his pocket. He hooked his thumbs in his belt and squinted one eye nearly closed. “Say—what you sellin’?”“Huh?”“I said what stake you got in this guy? You takin’ his pay away from him?”“No, ’course I ain’t. Why ya think I’m sellin’ him out?”“Well, I never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy. I just like to know what your interest is.”George said, “He’s my … cousin. I told his old lady I’d take care of him. He got kicked in the head by a horse when he was a kid. He’s awright. Just ain’t bright. But he can do anything you tell him.”The boss turned half away. “Well, God knows he don’t need any brains to buck barley bags. But don’t you try to put nothing over, Milton. I got my eye on you. Why’d you quit in Weed?”“Job was done,” said George promptly.“What kinda job?”“We … we was diggin’ a cesspool.”“All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, ’cause you can’t get away with nothing. I seen wise guys before. Go on out with the grain teams after dinner. They’re pickin’ up barley at the threshing machine. Go out with Slim’s team.”“Slim?”“Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at dinner.” He turned abruptly and went to the door, but before he went out he turned and looked for a long moment at the two men.When the sound of his footsteps had died away, George turned on Lennie. “So you wasn’t gonna say a word. You was gonna leave your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost us the job.”Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. “I forgot, George.”“Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of it.” He sat down heavily on the bunk. “Now he’s got his eye on us. Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big flapper shut after this.” He fell morosely silent.“George.”“What you want now?”“I wasn’t kicked in the head with no horse, was I, George?”“Be a damn good thing if you was,” George said viciously. “Save ever’body a hell of a lot of trouble.”“You said I was your cousin, George.”“Well, that was a lie. An’ I’m damn glad it was. If I was a relative of yours I’d shoot myself.” He stopped suddenly, stepped to the open front door and peered out. “Say, what the hell you doin’ listenin’?”The old man came slowly into the room. He had his broom in his hand. And at his heels there walked a dragfooted sheep dog, gray of muzzle, and with pale, blind old eyes. The dog struggled lamely to the side of the room and lay down, grunting softly to himself and licking his grizzled, moth–eaten coat. The swamper watched him until he was settled. “I wasn’t listenin’. I was jus’ standin’ in the shade a minute scratchin’ my dog. I jus’ now finished swampin’ our the wash house.”“You was pokin’ your big ears into our business,” George said. “I don’t like nobody to get nosey.”The old man looked uneasily from George to Lennie, and then back. “I jus’ come there,” he said. “I didn’t hear nothing you guys was sayin’. I ain’t interested in nothing you was sayin’. A guy on a ranch don’t never listen nor he don’t ast no questions.”“Damn right he don’t,” said George, slightly mollified, “not if he wants to stay workin’ long.” But he was reassured by the swamper’s defense. “Come on in and set down a minute,” he said. “That’s a hell of an old dog.”“Yeah. I had ’im ever since he was a pup. God, he was a good sheep dog when he was younger.” He stood his broom against the wall and he rubbed his white bristled cheek with his knuckles. “How’d you like the boss?” he asked.“Pretty good. Seemed awright.”“He’s a nice fella,” the swamper agreed. “You got to take him right.”At that moment a young man came into the bunk house; a thin young man with a brown face, with brown eyes and a head of tightly curled hair. He wore a work glove on his left hand, and, like the boss, he wore high–heeled boots. “Seen my old man?” he asked.The swamper said, “He was here jus’ a minute ago, Curley. Went over to the cook house, I think.”“I’ll try to catch him,” said Curley. His eyes passed over the new men and he stopped. He glanced coldly at George and then at Lennie. His arms gradually bent at the elbows and his hands closed into fists. He stiffened and went into a slight crouch. His glance was at once calculating and pugnacious. Lennie squirmed under the look and shifted his feet nervously. Curley stepped gingerly close to him. “You the new guys the old man was waitin’ for?”“We just come in,” said George.“Let the big guy talk.”Lennie twisted with embarrassment.George said, “S’pose he don’t want to talk?”Curley lashed his body around. “By Christ, he’s gotta talk when he’s spoke to. What the hell are you gettin’ into it for?”“We travel together,” said George coldly.“Oh, so it’s that way.”George was tense, and motionless. “Yeah, it’s that way.”Lennie was looking helplessly to George for instruction.“An’ you won’t let the big guy talk, is that it?”“He can talk if he wants to tell you anything.” He nodded slightly to Lennie.“We jus’ come in,” said Lennie softly.Curley stared levelly at him. “Well, nex’ time you answer when you’re spoke to.” He turned toward the door and walked out, and his elbows were still bent out a little.George watched him out, and then he turned back to the swamper. “Say, what the hell’s he got on his shoulder? Lennie didn’t do nothing to him.”The old man looked cautiously at the door to make sure no one was listening. “That’s the boss’s son,” he said quietly. “Curley’s pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, and he’s handy.”“Well, let him be handy,” said George. “He don’t have to take after Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against Lennie?”The swamper considered…. “Well … tell you what. Curley’s like a lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps with big guys. Kind of like he’s mad at ’em because he ain’t a big guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?”“Sure,” said George. “I seen plenty tough little guys. But this Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get hurt if he messes around with Lennie.”“Well, Curley’s pretty handy,” the swamper said skeptically. “Never did seem right to me. S’pose Curley jumps a big guy an’ licks him. Ever’body says what a game guy Curley is. And s’pose he does the same thing and gets licked. Then ever’body says the big guy oughtta pick somebody his own size, and maybe they gang up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley ain’t givin’ nobody a chance.”George was watching the door. He said ominously, “Well, he better watch out for Lennie. Lennie ain’t no fighter, but Lennie’s strong and quick and Lennie don’t know no rules.” He walked to the square table and sat down on one of the boxes. He gathered some of the cards together and shuffled them.The old man sat down on another box. “Don’t tell Curley I said none of this. He’d slough me. He just don’t give a damn. Won’t ever get canned ’cause his old man’s the boss.”George cut the cards and began turning them over, looking at each one and throwing it down on a pile. He said, “This guy Curley sounds like a son–of–a–bitch to me. I don’t like mean little guys.”“Seems to me like he’s worse lately,” said the swamper. “He got married a couple of weeks ago. Wife lives over in the boss’s house. Seems like Curley is cockier’n ever since he got married.”George grunted, “Maybe he’s showin’ off for his wife.”The swamper warmed to his gossip. “You seen that glove on his left hand?”“Yeah. I seen it.”“Well, that glove’s fulla vaseline.”“Vaseline? What the hell for?”“Well, I tell ya what—Curley says he’s keepin’ that hand soft for his wife.”George studied the cards absorbedly. “That’s a dirty thing to tell around,” he said.The old man was reassured. He had drawn a derogatory statement from George. He felt safe now, and he spoke more confidently. “Wait’ll you see Curley’s wife.”George cut the cards again and put out a solitaire lay, slowly and deliberately. “Purty?” he asked casually.“Yeah. Purty … but——”George studied his cards. “But what?”“Well—she got the eye.”“Yeah? Married two weeks and got the eye? Maybe that’s why Curley’s pants is full of ants.”“I seen her give Slim the eye. Slim’s a jerkline skinner. Hell of a nice fella. Slim don’t need to wear no high–heeled boots on a grain team. I seen her give Slim the eye. Curley never seen it. An’ I seen her give Carlson the eye.”George pretended a lack of interest. “Looks like we was gonna have fun.”The swamper stood up from his box. “Know what I think?” George did not answer. “Well, I think Curley’s married … a tart.”“He ain’t the first,” said George. “There’s plenty done that.”The old man moved toward the door, and his ancient dog lifted his head and peered about, and then got painfully to his feet to follow. “I gotta be settin’ out the wash basins for the guys. The teams’ll be in before long. You guys gonna buck barley?”“Yeah.”“You won’t tell Curley nothing I said?”“Hell no.”“Well, you look her over, mister. You see if she ain’t a tart.” He stepped out the door into the brilliant sunshine.George laid down his cards thoughtfully, turned his piles of three. He built four clubs on his ace pile. The sun square was on the floor now, and the flies whipped through it like sparks. A sound of jingling harness and the croak of heavy–laden axles sounded from outside. From the distance came a clear call. “Stable Buck—ooh, sta–able Buck!” And then, “Where the hell is that God damn nigger?”George stared at his solitaire lay, and then he flounced the cards together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on the bunk watching him.“Look, Lennie! This here ain’t no set up. I’m scared. You gonna have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was kinda feelin’ you out. He figures he’s got you scared and he’s gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets.”Lennie’s eyes were frightened. “I don’t want no trouble,” he said plaintively. “Don’t let him sock me, George.”George got up and went over to Lennie’s bunk and sat down on it. “I hate that kinda bastard,” he said. “I seen plenty of ’em. Like the old guy says, Curley don’t take no chances. He always wins.” He thought for a moment. “If he tangles with you, Lennie, we’re gonna get the can. Don’t make no mistake about that. He’s the boss’s son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you? Don’t never speak to him. If he comes in here you move clear to the other side of the room. Will you do that, Lennie?”“I don’t want no trouble,” Lennie mourned. “I never done nothing to him.”“Well, that won’t do you no good if Curley wants to plug himself up for a fighter. Just don’t have nothing to do with him. Will you remember?”“Sure, George. I ain’t gonna say a word.”The sound of the approaching grain teams was louder, thud of big hooves on hard ground, drag of brakes and the jingle of trace chains. Men were calling back and forth from the teams. George, sitting on the bunk beside Lennie, frowned as he thought. Lennie asked timidly, “You ain’t mad, George?”“I ain’t mad at you. I’m mad at this here Curley bastard. I hoped we was gonna get a little stake together—maybe a hundred dollars.” His tone grew decisive. “You keep away from Curley, Lennie.”“Sure I will, George. I won’t say a word.”“Don’t let him pull you in—but—if the son–of–a–bitch socks you—let ’im have it.”“Let ’im have what, George?”“Never mind, never mind. I’ll tell you when. I hate that kind of a guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any kind of trouble, you remember what I told you to do?”Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought. Then his eyes moved sadly to George’s face. “If I get in any trouble, you ain’t gonna let me tend the rabbits.”“That’s not what I meant. You remember where we slep’ last night? Down by the river?”“Yeah, I remember. Oh, sure I remember! I go there an’ hide in the brush.”“Hide till I come for you. Don’t let nobody see you. Hide in the brush by the river. Say that over.”“Hide in the brush by the river, down in the brush by the river.”“If you get in trouble.”“If I get in trouble.”A brake screeched outside. A call came, “Stable—Buck. Oh! Sta–able Buck.”George said, “Say it over to yourself, Lennie, so you won’t forget it.”Both men glanced up, for the rectangle of sunshine in the doorway was cut off. A girl was standing there looking in. She had full, rouged lips and wide–spaced eyes, heavily made up. Her fingernails were red. Her hair hung in little rolled clusters, like sausages. She wore a cotton house dress and red mules, on the insteps of which were little bouquets of red ostrich feathers. “I’m lookin’ for Curley,” she said. Her voice had a nasal, brittle quality.George looked away from her and then back. “He was in here a minute ago, but he went.”“Oh!” She put her hands behind her back and leaned against the door frame so that her body was thrown forward. “You’re the new fellas that just come, ain’t ya?”“Yeah.”Lennie’s eyes moved down over her body, and though she did not seem to be looking at Lennie she bridled a little. She looked at her fingernails. “Sometimes Curley’s in here,” she explained.George said brusquely, “Well he ain’t now.”“If he ain’t, I guess I better look some place else,” she said playfully.Lennie watched her, fascinated. George said, “If I see him, I’ll pass the word you was looking for him.”She smiled archly and twitched her body. “Nobody can’t blame a person for lookin’.” she said. There were footsteps behind her, going by. She turned her head. “Hi, Slim,” she said.Slim’s voice came through the door. “Hi, Good–lookin’.”“I’m tryin’ to find Curley, Slim.”“Well, you ain’t tryin’ very hard. I seen him goin’ in your house.”She was suddenly apprehensive. “’Bye, boys,” she called into the bunk house, and she hurried away.George looked around at Lennie. “Jesus, what a tramp,” he said. “So that’s what Curley picks for a wife.”“She’s purty,” said Lennie defensively.“Yeah, and she’s sure hidin’ it. Curley got his work ahead of him. Bet she’d clear out for twenty bucks.”Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. “Gosh, she was purty.” He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.“Listen to me, you crazy bastard,” he said fiercely. “Don’t you even take a look at that bitch. I don’t care what she says and what she does. I seen ’em poison before, but I never seen no piece of jail bait worse than her. You leave her be.”Lennie tried to disengage his ear. “I never done nothing, George.”“No, you never. But when she was standin’ in the doorway showin’ her legs, you wasn’t lookin’ the other way, neither.”“I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never.”“Well, you keep away from her, ’cause she’s a rat–trap if I ever seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. Glove fulla vaseline,” George said disgustedly. “An’ I bet he’s eatin’ raw eggs and writin’ to the patent medicine houses.”Lennie cried out suddenly—“I don’ like this place, George. This ain’t no good place. I wanna get outa here.”“We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can’t help it, Lennie. We’ll get out jus’ as soon as we can. I don’t like it no better than you do.” He went back to the table and set out a new solitaire hand. “No, I don’t like it,” he said. “For two bits I’d shove out of here. If we can get jus’ a few dollars in the poke we’ll shove off and go up the American River and pan gold. We can make maybe a couple of dollars a day there, and we might hit a pocket.”Lennie leaned eagerly toward him. “Le’s go, George. Le’s get outta here. It’s mean here.”“We gotta stay,” George said shortly. “Shut up now. The guys’ll be comin’ in.”From the washroom nearby came the sound of running water and rattling basins. George studied the cards. “Maybe we oughtta wash up,” he said. “But we ain’t done nothing to get dirty.”A tall man stood in the doorway. He held a crushed Stetson hat under his arm while he combed his long, black, damp hair straight back. Like the others he wore blue jeans and a short denim jacket. When he had finished combing his hair he moved into the room, and he moved with a majesty only achieved by royalty and master craftsmen. He was a jerkline skinner, the prince of the ranch, capable of driving ten, sixteen, even twenty mules with a single line to the leaders. He was capable of killing a fly on the wheeler’s butt with a bull whip without touching the mule. There was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talk stopped when he spoke. His authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject, be it politics or love. This was Slim, the jerkline skinner. His hatchet face was ageless. He might have been thirty–five or fifty. His ear heard more than was said to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of thought, but of understanding beyond thought. His hands, large and lean, were as delicate in their action as those of a temple dancer.He smoothed out his crushed hat, creased it in the middle and put it on. He looked kindly at the two in the bunk house. “It’s brighter’n a bitch outside,” he said gently. “Can’t hardly see nothing in here. You the new guys?”“Just come,” said George.“Gonna buck barley?”“That’s what the boss says.”Slim sat down on a box across the table from George. He studied the solitaire hand that was upside down to him. “Hope you get on my team,” he said. His voice was very gentle. “I gotta pair of punks on my team that don’t know a barley bag from a blue ball. You guys ever bucked any barley?”“Hell, yes,” said George. “I ain’t nothing to scream about, but that big bastard there can put up more grain alone than most pairs can.”Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth with his eyes, smiled complacently at the compliment. Slim looked approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. “You guys travel around together?” His tone was friendly. It invited confidence without demanding it.“Sure,” said George. “We kinda look after each other.” He indicated Lennie with his thumb. “He ain’t bright. Hell of a good worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain’t bright. I’ve knew him for a long time.”Slim looked through George and beyond him. “Ain’t many guys travel around together,” he mused. “I don’t know why. Maybe ever’body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.”“It’s a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know,” said George.A powerful, big–stomached man came into the bunk house. His head still dripped water from the scrubbing and dousing. “Hi, Slim,” he said, and then stopped and stared at George and Lennie.“These guys jus’ come,” said Slim by way of introduction.“Glad ta meet ya,” the big man said. “My name’s Carlson.”“I’m George Milton. This here’s Lennie Small.”“Glad ta meet ya,” Carlson said again. “He ain’t very small.” He chuckled softly at his joke. “Ain’t small at all,” he repeated. “Meant to ask you, Slim—how’s your bitch? I seen she wasn’t under your wagon this morning.”“She slang her pups last night,” said Slim. “Nine of ’em. I drowned four of ’em right off. She couldn’t feed that many.”“Got five left, huh?”“Yeah, five. I kept the biggest.”“What kinda dogs you think they’re gonna be?”“I dunno,” said Slim. “Some kinda shepherds, I guess. That’s the most kind I seen around here when she was in heat.”Carlson went on, “Got five pups, huh. Gonna keep all of ’em?”“I dunno. Have to keep ’em a while so they can drink Lulu’s milk.”Carlson said thoughtfully, “Well, looka here, Slim. I been thinkin’. That dog of Candy’s is so God damn old he can’t hardly walk. Stinks like hell, too. Ever’ time he comes into the bunk house I can smell him for two, three days. Why’n’t you get Candy to shoot his old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can’t eat. Candy feeds him milk. He can’t chew nothing else.”George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle began to ring outside, slowly at first, and then faster and faster until the beat of it disappeared into one ringing sound. It stopped as suddenly as it had started.“There she goes,” said Carlson.Outside, there was a burst of voices as a group of men went by.Slim stood up slowly and with dignity. “You guys better come on while they’s still something to eat. Won’t be nothing left in a couple of minutes.”Carlson stepped back to let Slim precede him, and then the two of them went out the door.Lennie was watching George excitedly. George rumpled his cards into a messy pile. “Yeah!” George said, “I heard him, Lennie. I’ll ask him.”“A brown and white one,” Lennie cried excitedly.“Come on. Le’s get dinner. I don’t know whether he got a brown and white one.”Lennie didn’t move from his bunk. “You ask him right away, George, so he won’t kill no more of ’em.”“Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet.”Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and the two of them started for the door. Just as they reached it, Curley bounced in.“You seen a girl around here?” he demanded angrily.George said coldly. “’Bout half an hour ago maybe.”“Well what the hell was she doin’?”George stood still, watching the angry little man. He said insultingly, “She said—she was lookin’ for you.”Curley seemed really to see George for the first time. His eyes flashed over George, took in his height, measured his reach, looked at his trim middle. “Well, which way’d she go?” he demanded at last.“I dunno,” said George. “I didn’t watch her go.”Curley scowled at him, and turning, hurried out the door.George said, “Ya know, Lennie, I’m scared I’m gonna tangle with that bastard myself. I hate his guts. Jesus Christ! Come on. They won’t be a damn thing left to eat.”They went out the door. The sunshine lay in a thin line under the window. From a distance there could be heard a rattle of dishes.After a moment the ancient dog walked lamely in through the open door. He gazed about with mild, half–blind eyes. He sniffed, and then lay down and put his head between his paws. Curley popped into the doorway again and stood looking into the room. The dog raised his head, but when Curley jerked out, the grizzled head sank to the floor again.');

(41, 6, 'ch03', 5, ' 33Although there was evening brightness showing through the windows of the bunk house, inside it was dusk. Through the open door came the thuds and occasional clangs of a horseshoe game, and now and then the sound of voices raised in approval or derision.Slim and George came into the darkening bunk house together. Slim reached up over the card table and turned on the tin–shaded electric light. Instantly the table was brilliant with light, and the cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward, leaving the corners of the bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box and George took his place opposite.“It wasn’t nothing,” said Slim. “I would of had to drowned most of ’em anyways. No need to thank me about that.”George said, “It wasn’t much to you, maybe, but it was a hell of a lot to him. Jesus Christ, I don’t know how we’re gonna get him to sleep in here. He’ll want to sleep right out in the barn with ’em. We’ll have trouble keepin’ him from getting right in the box with them pups.”“It wasn’t nothing,” Slim repeated. “Say, you sure was right about him. Maybe he ain’t bright, but I never seen such a worker. He damn near killed his partner buckin’ barley. There ain’t nobody can keep up with him. God awmighty I never seen such a strong guy.”George spoke proudly. “Jus’ tell Lennie what to do an’ he’ll do it if it don’t take no figuring. He can’t think of nothing to do himself, but he sure can take orders.”There was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside and a little cheer of voices.Slim moved back slightly so the light was not on his face. “Funny how you an’ him string along together.” It was Slim’s calm invitation to confidence.“What’s funny about it?” George demanded defensively.“Oh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever travel together. I hardly never seen two guys travel together. You know how the hands are, they just come in and get their bunk and work a month, and then they quit and go out alone. Never seem to give a damn about nobody. It jus’ seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him and a smart little guy like you travelin’ together.”“He ain’t no cuckoo,” said George. “He’s dumb as hell, but he ain’t crazy. An’ I ain’t so bright neither, or I wouldn’t be buckin’ barley for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit smart, I’d have my own little place, an’ I’d be bringin’ in my own crops, ’stead of doin’ all the work and not getting what comes up outa the ground.” George fell silent. He wanted to talk. Slim neither encouraged nor discouraged him. He just sat back quiet and receptive.“It ain’t so funny, him an’ me goin’ aroun’ together,” George said at last. “Him and me was both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt Clara. She took him when he was a baby and raised him up. When his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out workin’. Got kinda used to each other after a little while.”“Umm,” said Slim.George looked over at Slim and saw the calm, God–like eyes fastened on him. “Funny,” said George. “I used to have a hell of a lot of fun with ’im. Used to play jokes on ’im ’cause he was too dumb to take care of ’imself. But he was too dumb even to know he had a joke played on him. I had fun. Made me seem God damn smart alongside of him. Why he’d do any damn thing I tol’ him. If I tol’ him to walk over a cliff, over he’d go. That wasn’t so damn much fun after a while. He never got mad about it, neither. I’ve beat the hell outa him, and he coulda bust every bone in my body jus’ with his han’s, but he never lifted a finger against me.” George’s voice was taking on the tone of confession. “Tell you what made me stop that. One day a bunch of guys was standin’ around up on the Sacramento River. I was feelin’ pretty smart. I turns to Lennie and says, ‘Jump in.’ An’ he jumps. Couldn’t swim a stroke. He damn near drowned before we could get him. An’ he was so damn nice to me for pullin’ him out. Clean forgot I told him to jump in. Well, I ain’t done nothing like that no more.”“He’s a nice fella,” said Slim. “Guy don’t need no sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus’ works the other way around. Take a real smart guy and he ain’t hardly ever a nice fella.”George stacked the scattered cards and began to lay out his solitaire hand. The shoes thudded on the ground outside. At the windows the light of the evening still made the window squares bright.“I ain’t got no people,” George said. “I seen the guys that go around on the ranches alone. That ain’t no good. They don’t have no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin’ to fight all the time.”“Yeah, they get mean,” Slim agreed. “They get so they don’t want to talk to nobody.”“’Course Lennie’s a God damn nuisance most of the time,” said George. “But you get used to goin’ around with a guy an’ you can’t get rid of him.”“He ain’t mean,” said Slim. “I can see Lennie ain’t a bit mean.”“’Course he ain’t mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because he’s so God damn dumb. Like what happened in Weed——” He stopped, stopped in the middle of turning over a card. He looked alarmed and peered over at Slim. “You wouldn’t tell nobody?”“What’d he do in Weed?” Slim asked calmly.“You wouldn’ tell? … No, ’course you wouldn’.”“What’d he do in Weed?” Slim asked again.“Well, he seen this girl in a red dress. Dumb bastard like he is, he wants to touch ever’thing he likes. Just wants to feel it. So he reaches out to feel this red dress an’ the girl lets out a squawk, and that gets Lennie all mixed up, and he holds on ’cause that’s the only thing he can think to do. Well, this girl squawks and squawks. I was jus’ a little bit off, and I heard all the yellin’, so I comes running, an’ by that time Lennie’s so scared all he can think to do is jus’ hold on. I socked him over the head with a fence picket to make him let go. He was so scairt he couldn’t let go of that dress. And he’s so God damn strong, you know.”Slim’s eyes were level and unwinking. He nodded very slowly. “So what happens?”George carefully built his line of solitaire cards. “Well, that girl rabbits in an’ tells the law she been raped. The guys in Weed start a party out to lynch Lennie. So we sit in a irrigation ditch under water all the rest of that day. Got on’y our heads sticking out from the side of the ditch. An’ that night we scrammed outa there.”Slim sat in silence for a moment. “Didn’t hurt the girl none, huh?” he asked finally.“Hell, no. He just scared her. I’d be scared too if he grabbed me. But he never hurt her. He jus’ wanted to touch that red dress, like he wants to pet them pups all the time.”“He ain’t mean,” said Slim. “I can tell a mean guy a mile off.”“’Course he ain’t, and he’ll do any damn thing I——”Lennie came in through the door. He wore his blue denim coat over his shoulders like a cape, and he walked hunched way over.“Hi, Lennie,” said George. “How do you like the pup now?”Lennie said breathlessly, “He’s brown an’ white jus’ like I wanted.” He went directly to his bunk and lay down and turned his face to the wall and drew up his knees.George put down his cards very deliberately. “Lennie,” he said sharply.Lennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder. “Huh? What you want, George?”“I tol’ you you couldn’t bring that pup in here.”“What pup, George? I ain’t got no pup.”George went quickly to him, grabbed him by the shoulder and rolled him over. He reached down and picked the tiny puppy from where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach.Lennie sat up quickly. “Give ’um to me, George.”George said, “You get right up an’ take this pup back to the nest. He’s gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born last night an’ you take him out of the nest. You take him back or I’ll tell Slim not to let you have him.”Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. “Give ’um to me, George. I’ll take ’um back. I didn’t mean no harm, George. Honest I didn’t. I jus’ wanted to pet ’um a little.”George handed the pup to him. “Awright. You get him back there quick, and don’ you take him out no more. You’ll kill him, the first thing you know.” Lennie fairly scuttled out of the room.Slim had not moved. His calm eyes followed Lennie out the door. “Jesus,” he said. “He’s jes’ like a kid, ain’t he.”“Sure he’s jes’ like a kid. There ain’t no more harm in him than a kid neither, except he’s so strong. I bet he won’t come in here to sleep tonight. He’d sleep right alongside that box in the barn. Well—let ’im. He ain’t doin’ no harm out there.”It was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, the swamper, came in and went to his bunk, and behind him struggled his old dog. “Hello, Slim. Hello, George. Didn’t neither of you play horseshoes?”“I don’t like to play ever’ night,” said Slim.Candy went on, “Either you guys got a slug of whisky? I gotta gut ache.”“I ain’t,” said Slim. “I’d drink it myself if I had, an’ I ain’t got a gut ache neither.”“Gotta bad gut ache,” said Candy. “Them God damn turnips give it to me. I knowed they was going to before I ever eat ’em.”The thick–bodied Carlson came in out of the darkening yard. He walked to the other end of the bunk house and turned on the second shaded light. “Darker’n hell in here,” he said. “Jesus, how that nigger can pitch shoes.”“He’s plenty good,” said Slim.“Damn right he is,” said Carlson. “He don’t give nobody else a chance to win——” He stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, looked down at the old dog. “God awmighty, that dog stinks. Get him outa here, Candy! I don’t know nothing that stinks as bad as an old dog. You gotta get him out.”Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached over and patted the ancient dog, and he apologized, “I been around him so much I never notice how he stinks.”“Well, I can’t stand him in here,” said Carlson. “That stink hangs around even after he’s gone.” He walked over with his heavy–legged stride and looked down at the dog. “Got no teeth,” he said. “He’s all stiff with rheumatism. He ain’t no good to you, Candy. An’ he ain’t no good to himself. Why’n’t you shoot him, Candy?”The old man squirmed uncomfortably. “Well—hell! I had him so long. Had him since he was a pup, I herded sheep with him.” He said proudly, “You wouldn’t think it to look at him now, but he was the best damn sheep dog I ever seen.”George said, “I seen a guy in Weed that had an Airedale could herd sheep. Learned it from the other dogs.”Carlson was not to be put off. “Look, Candy. This ol’ dog jus’ suffers hisself all the time. If you was to take him out and shoot him right in the back of the head—” he leaned over and pointed, “—right there, why he’d never know what hit him.”Candy looked about unhappily. “No,” he said softly. “No, I couldn’ do that. I had ’im too long.”“He don’t have no fun,” Carlson insisted. “And he stinks to beat hell. Tell you what. I’ll shoot him for you. Then it won’t be you that does it.”Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble whiskers on his cheek nervously. “I’m so used to him,” he said softly. “I had him from a pup.”“Well, you ain’t bein’ kind to him keepin’ him alive,” said Carlson. “Look, Slim’s bitch got a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you one of them pups to raise up, wouldn’t you, Slim?”The skinner had been studying the old dog with his calm eyes. “Yeah,” he said. “You can have a pup if you want to.” He seemed to shake himself free for speech. “Carl’s right, Candy. That dog ain’t no good to himself. I wisht somebody’d shoot me if I got old an’ a cripple.”Candy looked helplessly at him, for Slim’s opinions were law. “Maybe it’d hurt him,” he suggested. “I don’t mind takin’ care of him.”Carlson said, “The way I’d shoot him, he wouldn’t feel nothing. I’d put the gun right there.” He pointed with his toe. “Right back of the head. He wouldn’t even quiver.”Candy looked for help from face to face. It was quite dark outside by now. A young laboring man came in. His sloping shoulders were bent forward and he walked heavily on his heels, as though he carried the invisible grain bag. He went to his bunk and put his hat on his shelf. Then he picked a pulp magazine from his shelf and brought it to the light over the table. “Did I show you this, Slim?” he asked.“Show me what?”The young man turned to the back of the magazine, put it down on the table and pointed with his finger. “Right there, read that.” Slim bent over it. “Go on,” said the young man. “Read it out loud.”“‘Dear Editor:’” Slim read slowly. “‘I read your mag for six years and I think it is the best on the market. I like stories by Peter Rand. I think he is a whing–ding. Give us more like the Dark Rider. I don’t write many letters. Just thought I would tell you I think your mag is the best dime’s worth I ever spent.’”Slim looked up questioningly. “What you want me to read that for?”Whit said, “Go on. Read the name at the bottom.”Slim read, “‘Yours for success, William Tenner.’” He glanced up at Whit again. “What you want me to read that for?”Whit closed the magazine impressively. “Don’t you remember Bill Tenner? Worked here about three months ago?”Slim thought…. “Little guy?” he asked. “Drove a cultivator?”“That’s him,” Whit cried. “That’s the guy!”“You think he’s the guy wrote this letter?”“I know it. Bill and me was in here one day. Bill had one of them books that just come. He was lookin’ in it and he says, ‘I wrote a letter. Wonder if they put it in the book!’ But it wasn’t there. Bill says, ‘Maybe they’re savin’ it for later.’ An’ that’s just what they done. There it is.”“Guess you’re right,” said Slim. “Got it right in the book.”George held out his hand for the magazine. “Let’s look at it?”Whit found the place again, but he did not surrender his hold on it. He pointed out the letter with his forefinger. And then he went to his box shelf and laid the magazine carefully in. “I wonder if Bill seen it,” he said. “Bill and me worked in that patch of field peas. Run cultivators, both of us. Bill was a hell of a nice fella.”During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him uneasily. At last Carlson said, “If you want me to, I’ll put the old devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain’t nothing left for him. Can’t eat, can’t see, can’t even walk without hurtin’.”Candy said hopefully, “You ain’t got no gun.”“The hell I ain’t. Got a Luger. It won’t hurt him none at all.”Candy said, “Maybe tomorra. Le’s wait till tomorra.”“I don’t see no reason for it,” said Carlson. He went to his bunk, pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. “Let’s get it over with,” he said. “We can’t sleep with him stinkin’ around in here.” He put the pistol in his hip pocket.Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And Slim gave him none. At last Candy said softly and hopelessly, “Awright—take ’im.” He did not look down at the dog at all. He lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling.From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong. He stooped over and tied it around the old dog’s neck. All the men except Candy watched him. “Come boy. Come on, boy,” he said gently. And he said apologetically to Candy, “He won’t even feel it.” Candy did not move nor answer him. He twitched the thong. “Come on, boy.” The old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently pulling leash.Slim said, “Carlson.”“Yeah?”“You know what to do.”“What ya mean, Slim?”“Take a shovel,” said Slim shortly.“Oh, sure! I get you.” He led the dog out into the darkness.George followed to the door and shut the door and set the latch gently in its place. Candy lay rigidly on his bed staring at the ceiling.Slim said loudly, “One of my lead mules got a bad hoof. Got to get some tar on it.” His voice trailed off. It was silent outside. Carlson’s footsteps died away. The silence came into the room. And the silence lasted.George chuckled, “I bet Lennie’s right out there in the barn with his pup. He won’t want to come in here no more now he’s got a pup.”Slim said, “Candy, you can have any one of them pups you want.”Candy did not answer. The silence fell on the room again. It came out of the night and invaded the room. George said, “Anybody like to play a little euchre?”“I’ll play out a few with you,” said Whit.They took places opposite each other at the table under the light, but George did not shuffle the cards. He rippled the edge of the deck nervously, and the little snapping noise drew the eyes of all the men in the room, so that he stopped doing it. The silence fell on the room again. A minute passed, and another minute. Candy lay still, staring at the ceiling. Slim gazed at him for a moment and then looked down at his hands; he subdued one hand with the other, and held it down. There came a little gnawing sound from under the floor and all the men looked down toward it gratefully. Only Candy continued to stare at the ceiling.“Sounds like there was a rat under there,” said George. “We ought to get a trap down there.”Whit broke out, “What the hell’s takin’ him so long? Lay out some cards, why don’t you? We ain’t going to get no euchre played this way.”George brought the cards together tightly and studied the backs of them. The silence was in the room again.A shot sounded in the distance. The men looked quickly at the old man. Every head turned toward him.For a moment he continued to stare at the ceiling. Then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay silent.George shuffled the cards noisily and dealt them. Whit drew a scoring board to him and set the pegs to start. Whit said, “I guess you guys really come here to work.”“How do ya mean?” George asked.Whit laughed. “Well, ya come on a Friday. You got two days to work till Sunday.”“I don’t see how you figure,” said George.Whit laughed again. “You do if you been around these big ranches much. Guy that wants to look over a ranch comes in Sat’day afternoon. He gets Sat’day night supper an’ three meals on Sunday, and he can quit Monday mornin’ after breakfast without turning his hand. But you come to work Friday noon. You got to put in a day an’ a half no matter how you figure.”George looked at him levelly. “We’re gonna stick aroun’ a while,” he said. “Me an’ Lennie’s gonna roll up a stake.”The door opened quietly and the stable buck put in his head; a lean negro head, lined with pain, the eyes patient. “Mr. Slim.”Slim took his eyes from old Candy. “Huh? Oh! Hello, Crooks. What’s’a matter?”“You told me to warm up tar for that mule’s foot. I got it warm.”“Oh! Sure, Crooks. I’ll come right out an’ put it on.”“I can do it if you want, Mr. Slim.”“No. I’ll come do it myself.” He stood up.Crooks said, “Mr. Slim.”“Yeah.”“That big new guy’s messin’ around your pups out in the barn.”“Well, he ain’t doin’ no harm. I give him one of them pups.”“Just thought I’d tell ya,” said Crooks. “He’s takin’ ’em outa the nest and handlin’ them. That won’t do them no good.”“He won’t hurt ’em,” said Slim. “I’ll come along with you now.”George looked up. “If that crazy bastard’s foolin’ around too much, jus’ kick him out, Slim.”Slim followed the stable buck out of the room.George dealt and Whit picked up his cards and examined them. “Seen the new kid yet?” he asked.“What kid?” George asked.“Why, Curley’s new wife.”“Yeah, I seen her.”“Well, ain’t she a looloo?”“I ain’t seen that much of her,” said George.Whit laid down his cards impressively. “Well, stick around an’ keep your eyes open. You’ll see plenty. She ain’t concealin’ nothing. I never seen nobody like her. She got the eye goin’ all the time on everybody. I bet she even gives the stable buck the eye. I don’t know what the hell she wants.”George asked casually, “Been any trouble since she got here?”It was obvious that Whit was not interested in his cards. He laid his hand down and George scooped it in. George laid out his deliberate solitaire hand—seven cards, and six on top, and five on top of those.Whit said, “I see what you mean. No, they ain’t been nothing yet. Curley’s got yella–jackets in his drawers, but that’s all so far. Ever’ time the guys is around she shows up. She’s lookin’ for Curley, or she thought she lef’ somethin’ layin’ around and she’s lookin’ for it. Seems like she can’t keep away from guys. An’ Curley’s pants is just crawlin’ with ants, but they ain’t nothing come of it yet.”George said, “She’s gonna make a mess. They’s gonna be a bad mess about her. She’s a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley got his work cut out for him. Ranch with a bunch of guys on it ain’t no place for a girl, specially like her.”Whit said, “If you got idears, you ought ta come in town with us guys tomorra night.”“Why? What’s doin’?”“Jus’ the usual thing. We go in to old Susy’s place. Hell of a nice place. Old Susy’s a laugh—always crackin’ jokes. Like she says when we come up on the front porch las’ Sat’day night. Susy opens the door and then she yells over her shoulder, ‘Get yor coats on, girls, here comes the sheriff.’ She never talks dirty, neither. Got five girls there.”“What’s it set you back?” George asked.“Two an’ a half. You can get a shot for two bits. Susy got nice chairs to set in, too. If a guy don’t want a flop, why he can just set in the chairs and have a couple or three shots and pass the time of day and Susy don’t give a damn. She ain’t rushin’ guys through and kickin’ ’em out if they don’t want a flop.”“Might go in and look the joint over,” said George.“Sure. Come along. It’s a hell of a lot of fun—her crackin’ jokes all the time. Like she says one time, she says, ‘I’ve knew people that if they got a rag rug on the floor an’ a kewpie doll lamp on the phonograph they think they’re running a parlor house.’ That’s Clara’s house she’s talkin’ about. An’ Susy says, ‘I know what you boys want,’ she says. ‘My girls is clean,’ she says, ‘an’ there ain’t no water in my whisky,’ she says. ‘If any you guys wanta look at a kewpie doll lamp an’ take your own chance gettin’ burned, why you know where to go.’ An’ she says, ‘There’s guys around here walkin’ bow–legged ’cause they like to look at a kewpie doll lamp.’”George asked, “Clara runs the other house, huh?”“Yeah,” said Whit. “We don’t never go there. Clara gets three bucks a crack and thirty–five cents a shot, and she don’t crack no jokes. But Susy’s place is clean and she got nice chairs. Don’t let no goo–goos in, neither.”“Me an’ Lennie’s rollin’ up a stake,” said George. “I might go in an’ set and have a shot, but I ain’t puttin’ out no two and a half.”“Well, a guy got to have some fun sometime,” said Whit.The door opened and Lennie and Carlson came in together. Lennie crept to his bunk and sat down, trying not to attract attention. Carlson reached under his bunk and brought out his bag. He didn’t look at old Candy, who still faced the wall. Carlson found a little cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil. He laid them on his bed and then brought out the pistol, took out the magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the chamber. Then he fell to cleaning the barrel with the little rod. When the ejector snapped, Candy turned over and looked for a moment at the gun before he turned back to the wall again.Carlson said casually, “Curley been in yet?”“No,” said Whit. “What’s eatin’ on Curley?”Carlson squinted down the barrel of his gun. “Lookin’ for his old lady. I seen him going round and round outside.”Whit said sarcastically, “He spends half his time lookin’ for her, and the rest of the time she’s lookin’ for him.”Curley burst into the room excitedly. “Any you guys seen my wife?” he demanded.“She ain’t been here,” said Whit.Curley looked threateningly about the room. “Where the hell’s Slim?”“Went out in the barn,” said George. “He was gonna put some tar on a split hoof.”Curley’s shoulders dropped and squared. “How long ago’d he go?”“Five—ten minutes.”Curley jumped out the door and banged it after him.Whit stood up. “I guess maybe I’d like to see this,” he said. “Curley’s just spoilin’ or he wouldn’t start for Slim. An’ Curley’s handy, God damn handy. Got in the finals for the Golden Gloves. He got newspaper clippings about it.” He considered. “But jus’ the same, he better leave Slim alone. Nobody don’t know what Slim can do.”“Thinks Slim’s with his wife, don’t he?” said George.“Looks like it,” Whit said. “’Course Slim ain’t. Least I don’t think Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le’s go.”George said, “I’m stayin’ right here. I don’t want to get mixed up in nothing. Lennie and me got to make a stake.”Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and pushed the bag under his bunk. “I guess I’ll go out and look her over,” he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, watched George cautiously.When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after them, George turned to Lennie. “What you got on your mind?”“I ain’t done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain’t good for them; so I come right in. I been good, George.”“I coulda told you that,” said George.“Well, I wasn’t hurtin’ ’em none. I jus’ had mine in my lap pettin’ it.”George asked, “Did you see Slim out in the barn?”“Sure I did. He tol’ me I better not pet that pup no more.”“Did you see that girl?”“You mean Curley’s girl?”“Yeah. Did she come in the barn?”“No. Anyways I never seen her.”“You never seen Slim talkin’ to her?”“Uh–uh. She ain’t been in the barn.”“O.K.,” said George. “I guess them guys ain’t gonna see no fight. If there’s any fightin’, Lennie, you keep out of it.”“I don’t want no fights,” said Lennie. He got up from his bunk and sat down at the table, across from George. Almost automatically George shuffled the cards and laid out his solitaire hand. He used a deliberate, thoughtful, slowness.Lennie reached for a face card and studied it, then turned it upside down and studied it. “Both ends the same,” he said. “George, why is it both end’s the same?”“I don’t know,” said George. “That’s jus’ the way they make ’em. What was Slim doin’ in the barn when you seen him?”“Slim?”“Sure. You seen him in the barn, an’ he tol’ you not to pet the pups so much.”“Oh, yeah. He had a can a’ tar an’ a paint brush. I don’t know what for.”“You sure that girl didn’t come in like she come in here today?”“No. She never come.”George sighed. “You give me a good whore house every time,” he said. “A guy can go in an’ get drunk and get ever’thing outa his system all at once, an’ no messes. And he knows how much it’s gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger of the hoosegow.”Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little to keep up. George continued, “You remember Andy Cushman, Lennie? Went to grammar school?”“The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?” Lennie asked.“Yeah. That’s the one. You can remember anything if there’s anything to eat in it.” George looked carefully at the solitaire hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three and four of diamonds on it. “Andy’s in San Quentin right now on account of a tart,” said George.Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. “George?”“Huh?”“George, how long’s it gonna be till we get that little place an’ live on the fatta the lan’—an’ rabbits?”“I don’ know,” said George. “We gotta get a big stake together. I know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain’t givin’ it away.”Old Candy turned slowly over. His eyes were wide open. He watched George carefully.Lennie said, “Tell about that place, George.”“I jus’ tol’ you, jus’ las’ night.”“Go on—tell again, George.”“Well, it’s ten acres,” said George. “Got a little win’mill. Got a little shack on it, an’ a chicken run. Got a kitchen, orchard, cherries, apples, peaches, ’cots, nuts, got a few berries. They’s a place for alfalfa and plenty water to flood it. They’s a pig pen——”“An’ rabbits, George.”“No place for rabbits now, but I could easy build a few hutches and you could feed alfalfa to the rabbits.”“Damn right, I could,” said Lennie. “You God damn right I could.”George’s hands stopped working with the cards. His voice was growing warmer. “An’ we could have a few pigs. I could build a smoke house like the one gran’pa had, an’ when we kill a pig we can smoke the bacon and the hams, and make sausage an’ all like that. An’ when the salmon run up river we could catch a hundred of ’em an’ salt ’em down or smoke ’em. We could have them for breakfast. They ain’t nothing so nice as smoked salmon. When the fruit come in we could can it—and tomatoes, they’re easy to can. Ever’ Sunday we’d kill a chicken or a rabbit. Maybe we’d have a cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it with a knife and take it out with a spoon.”Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy watched him too. Lennie said softly, “We could live offa the fatta the lan’.”“Sure,” said George. “All kin’s a vegetables in the garden, and if we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or some milk. We’d jus’ live there. We’d belong there. There wouldn’t be no more runnin’ round the country and gettin’ fed by a Jap cook. No, sir, we’d have our own place where we belonged and not sleep in no bunk house.”“Tell about the house, George,” Lennie begged.“Sure, we’d have a little house an’ a room to ourself. Little fat iron stove, an’ in the winter we’d keep a fire goin’ in it. It ain’t enough land so we’d have to work too hard. Maybe six, seven hours a day. We wouldn’t have to buck no barley eleven hours a day. An’ when we put in a crop, why, we’d be there to take the crop up. We’d know what come of our planting.”“An’ rabbits,” Lennie said eagerly. “An’ I’d take care of ’em. Tell how I’d do that, George.”“Sure, you’d go out in the alfalfa patch an’ you’d have a sack. You’d fill up the sack and bring it in an’ put it in the rabbit cages.”“They’d nibble an’ they’d nibble,” said Lennie, “the way they do. I seen ’em.”“Ever’ six weeks or so,” George continued, “them does would throw a litter so we’d have plenty rabbits to eat an’ to sell. An’ we’d keep a few pigeons to go flyin’ around the win’mill like they done when I was a kid.” He looked raptly at the wall over Lennie’s head. “An’ it’d be our own, an’ nobody could can us. If we don’t like a guy we can say, ‘Get the hell out,’ and by God he’s got to do it. An’ if a fren’ come along, why we’d have an extra bunk, an’ we’d say, ‘Why don’t you spen’ the night?’ an’ by God he would. We’d have a setter dog and a couple stripe cats, but you gotta watch out them cats don’t get the little rabbits.”Lennie breathed hard. “You jus’ let ’em try to get the rabbits. I’ll break their God damn necks. I’ll … I’ll smash ’em with a stick.” He subsided, grumbling to himself, threatening the future cats which might dare to disturb the future rabbits.George sat entranced with his own picture.When Candy spoke they both jumped as though they had been caught doing something reprehensible. Candy said, “You know where’s a place like that?”George was on guard immediately. “S’pose I do,” he said. “What’s that to you?”“You don’t need to tell me where it’s at. Might be any place.”“Sure,” said George. “That’s right. You couldn’t find it in a hundred years.”Candy went on excitedly, “How much they want for a place like that?”George watched him suspiciously. “Well—I could get it for six hundred bucks. The ol’ people that owns it is flat bust an’ the ol’ lady needs an operation. Say—what’s it to you? You got nothing to do with us.”Candy said, “I ain’t much good with on’y one hand. I lost my hand right here on this ranch. That’s why they give me a job swampin’. An’ they give me two hunderd an’ fifty dollars ’cause I los’ my hand. An’ I got fifty more saved up right in the bank, right now. Tha’s three hunderd, and I got fifty more comin’ the end a the month. Tell you what—” He leaned forward eagerly. “S’pose I went in with you guys. Tha’s three hunderd an’ fifty bucks I’d put in. I ain’t much good, but I could cook and tend the chickens and hoe the garden some. How’d that be?”George half–closed his eyes. “I gotta think about that. We was always gonna do it by ourselves.”Candy interrupted him, “I’d make a will an’ leave my share to you guys in case I kick off, ’cause I ain’t got no relatives nor nothing. You guys got any money? Maybe we could do her right now?”George spat on the floor disgustedly. “We got ten bucks between us.” Then he said thoughtfully, “Look, if me an’ Lennie work a month an’ don’t spen’ nothing, we’ll have a hunderd bucks. That’d be four fifty. I bet we could swing her for that. Then you an’ Lennie could go get her started an’ I’d get a job an’ make up the res’, an’ you could sell eggs an’ stuff like that.”They fell into a silence. They looked at one another, amazed. This thing they had never really believed in was coming true. George said reverently, “Jesus Christ! I bet we could swing her.” His eyes were full of wonder. “I bet we could swing her,” he repeated softly.Candy sat on the edge of his bunk. He scratched the stump of his wrist nervously. “I got hurt four years ago,” he said. “They’ll can me purty soon. Jus’ as soon as I can’t swamp out no bunk houses they’ll put me on the county. Maybe if I give you guys my money, you’ll let me hoe in the garden even after I ain’t no good at it. An’ I’ll wash dishes an’ little chicken stuff like that. But I’ll be on our own place, an’ I’ll be let to work on our own place.” He said miserably, “You seen what they done to my dog tonight? They says he wasn’t no good to himself nor nobody else. When they can me here I wisht somebody’d shoot me. But they won’t do nothing like that. I won’t have no place to go, an’ I can’t get no more jobs. I’ll have thirty dollars more comin’, time you guys is ready to quit.”George stood up. “We’ll do her,” he said. “We’ll fix up that little old place an’ we’ll go live there.” He sat down again. They all sat still, all bemused by the beauty of the thing, each mind was popped into the future when this lovely thing should come about.George said wonderingly, “S’pose they was a carnival or a circus come to town, or a ball game, or any damn thing.” Old Candy nodded in appreciation of the idea. “We’d just go to her,” George said. “We wouldn’t ask nobody if we could. Jus’ say, ‘We’ll go to her,’ an’ we would. Jus’ milk the cow and sling some grain to the chickens an’ go to her.”“An’ put some grass to the rabbits,” Lennie broke in. “I wouldn’t never forget to feed them. When we gon’ta do it, George?”“In one month. Right squack in one month. Know what I’m gon’ta do? I’m gon’ta write to them old people that owns the place that we’ll take it. An’ Candy’ll send a hunderd dollars to bind her.”“Sure will,” said Candy. “They got a good stove there?”“Sure, got a nice stove, burns coal or wood.”“I’m gonna take my pup,” said Lennie. “I bet by Christ he likes it there, by Jesus.”Voices were approaching from outside. George said quickly, “Don’t tell nobody about it. Jus’ us three an’ nobody else. They li’ble to can us so we can’t make no stake. Jus’ go on like we was gonna buck barley the rest of our lives, then all of a sudden some day we’ll go get our pay an’ scram outa here.”Lennie and Candy nodded, and they were grinning with delight. “Don’t tell nobody,” Lennie said to himself.Candy said, “George.”“Huh?”“I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn’t ought to of let no stranger shoot my dog.”The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson and Whit. Slim’s hands were black with tar and he was scowling. Curley hung close to his elbow.Curley said, “Well, I didn’t mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you.”Slim said, “Well, you been askin’ me too often. I’m gettin’ God damn sick of it. If you can’t look after your own God damn wife, what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me.”“I’m jus’ tryin’ to tell you I didn’t mean nothing,” said Curley. “I jus’ thought you might of saw her.”“Why’n’t you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?” said Carlson. “You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty soon you’re gonna have som’pin on your hands and you won’t be able to do nothing about it.”Curley whirled on Carlson. “You keep outta this les’ you wanta step outside.”Carlson laughed. “You God damn punk,” he said. “You tried to throw a scare into Slim, an’ you couldn’t make it stick. Slim throwed a scare inta you. You’re yella as a frog belly. I don’t care if you’re the best welter in the country. You come for me, an’ I’ll kick your God damn head off.”Candy joined the attack with joy. “Glove fulla vaseline,” he said disgustedly. Curley glared at him. His eyes slipped on past and lighted on Lennie; and Lennie was still smiling with delight at the memory of the ranch.Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. “What the hell you laughin’ at?”Lennie looked blankly at him. “Huh?”Then Curley’s rage exploded. “Come on, ya big bastard. Get up on your feet. No big son–of–a–bitch is gonna laugh at me. I’ll show ya who’s yella.”Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got up and tried to retreat. Curley was balanced and poised. He slashed at Lennie with his left, and then smashed down his nose with a right. Lennie gave a cry of terror. Blood welled from his nose. “George,” he cried. “Make ’um let me alone, George.” He backed until he was against the wall, and Curley followed, slugging him in the face. Lennie’s hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to defend himself.George was on his feet yelling, “Get him, Lennie. Don’t let him do it.”Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with terror. He cried, “Make ’um stop, George.” Then Curley attacked his stomach and cut off his wind.Slim jumped up. “The dirty little rat,” he cried, “I’ll get ’um myself.”George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. “Wait a minute,” he shouted. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, “Get ’im, Lennie!”Lennie took his hands away from his face and looked about for George, and Curley slashed at his eyes. The big face was covered with blood. George yelled again, “I said get him.”Curley’s fist was swinging when Lennie reached for it. The next minute Curley was flopping like a fish on a line, and his closed fist was lost in Lennie’s big hand. George ran down the room. “Leggo of him, Lennie. Let go.”But Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he held. Blood ran down Lennie’s face, one of his eyes was cut and closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still Lennie held on to the closed fist. Curley was white and shrunken by now, and his struggling had become weak. He stood crying, his fist lost in Lennie’s paw.George shouted over and over, “Leggo his hand, Lennie. Leggo. Slim, come help me while the guy got any hand left.”Suddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouched cowering against the wall. “You tol’ me to, George,” he said miserably.Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up and regarded Lennie with horror. “We got to get him in to a doctor,” he said. “Looks to me like ever’ bone in his han’ is bust.”“I didn’t wanta,” Lennie cried. “I didn’t wanta hurt him.”Slim said, “Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We’ll take ’um into Soledad an’ get ’um fixed up.” Carlson hurried out. Slim turned to the whimpering Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” he said. “This punk sure had it comin’ to him. But—Jesus! He ain’t hardly got no han’ left.” Slim hurried out, and in a moment returned with a tin cup of water. He held it to Curley’s lips.George said, “Slim, will we get canned now? We need the stake. Will Curley’s old man can us now?”Slim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside Curley. “You got your senses in hand enough to listen?” he asked. Curley nodded. “Well, then listen,” Slim went on. “I think you got your han’ caught in a machine. If you don’t tell nobody what happened, we ain’t going to. But you jus’ tell an’ try to get this guy canned and we’ll tell ever’body, an’ then will you get the laugh.”“I won’t tell,” said Curley. He avoided looking at Lennie.Buggy wheels sounded outside. Slim helped Curley up. “Come on now. Carlson’s gonna take you to a doctor.” He helped Curley out the door. The sound of wheels drew away. In a moment Slim came back into the bunk house. He looked at Lennie, still crouched fearfully against the wall. “Le’s see your hands,” he asked.Lennie stuck out his hands.“Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me,” Slim said.George broke in, “Lennie was jus’ scairt,” he explained. “He didn’t know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I guess it was Candy I told.”Candy nodded solemnly. “That’s jus’ what you done,” he said. “Right this morning when Curley first lit intil your fren’, you says. ‘He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what’s good for ’um.’ That’s jus’ what you says to me.”George turned to Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” he said. “You don’t need to be scairt no more. You done jus’ what I tol’ you to. Maybe you better go in the wash room an’ clean up your face. You look like hell.”Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. “I didn’t want no trouble,” he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, he turned back. “George?”“What you want?”“I can still tend the rabbits, George?”“Sure. You ain’t done nothing wrong.”“I di’n’t mean no harm, George.”“Well, get the hell out and wash your face.”');

(42, 6, 'ch04', 6, ' 44Crooks, the negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn. On one side of the little room there was a square four–paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks’ bunk was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended; strips of new leather; and under the window itself a little bench for leather–working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering split. Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back.Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a big alarm clock and a single–barreled shotgun. And he had books, too; a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil code for 1905. There were battered magazines and a few dirty books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold–rimmed spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed.This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks was a proud, aloof man. He kept his distance and demanded that other people keep theirs. His body was bent over to the left by his crooked spine, and his eyes lay deep in his head, and because of their depth seemed to glitter with intensity. His lean face was lined with deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain–tightened lips which were lighter than his face.It was Saturday night. Through the open door that led into the barn came the sound of moving horses, of feet stirring, of teeth champing on hay, of the rattle of halter chains. In the stable buck’s room a small electric globe threw a meager yellow light.Crooks sat on his bunk. His shirt was out of his jeans in back. In one hand he held a bottle of liniment, and with the other he rubbed his spine. Now and then he poured a few drops of the liniment into his pink–palmed hand and reached up under his shirt to rub again. He flexed his muscles against his back and shivered.Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking in, his big shoulders nearly filling the opening. For a moment Crooks did not see him, but on raising his eyes he stiffened and a scowl came on his face. His hand came out from under his shirt.Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends.Crooks said sharply, “You got no right to come in my room. This here’s my room. Nobody got any right in here but me.”Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. “I ain’t doing nothing,” he said. “Just come to look at my puppy. And I seen your light,” he explained.“Well, I got a right to have a light. You go on get outta my room. I ain’t wanted in the bunk house, and you ain’t wanted in my room.”“Why ain’t you wanted?” Lennie asked.“’Cause I’m black. They play cards in there, but I can’t play because I’m black. They say I stink. Well, I tell you, you all of you stink to me.”Lennie flapped his big hands helplessly. “Ever’body went into town,” he said. “Slim an’ George an’ ever’body. George says I gotta stay here an’ not get in no trouble. I seen your light.”“Well, what do you want?”“Nothing—I seen your light. I thought I could jus’ come in an’ set.”Crooks stared at Lennie, and he reached behind him and took down the spectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and stared again. “I don’t know what you’re doin’ in the barn anyway,” he complained. “You ain’t no skinner. They’s no call for a bucker to come into the barn at all. You ain’t no skinner. You ain’t got nothing to do with the horses.”“The pup,” Lennie repeated. “I come to see my pup.”“Well, go see your pup, then. Don’t come in a place where you’re not wanted.”Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into the room, then remembered and backed to the door again. “I looked at ’em a little. Slim says I ain’t to pet ’em very much.”Crooks said, “Well, you been takin’ ’em out of the nest all the time. I wonder the old lady don’t move ’em someplace else.”“Oh, she don’t care. She lets me.” Lennie had moved into the room again.Crooks scowled, but Lennie’s disarming smile defeated him. “Come on in and set a while,” Crooks said. “’Long as you won’t get out and leave me alone, you might as well set down.” His tone was a little more friendly. “All the boys gone into town, huh?”“All but old Candy. He just sets in the bunk house sharpening his pencil and sharpening and figuring.”Crooks adjusted his glasses. “Figuring? What’s Candy figuring about?”Lennie almost shouted, “’Bout the rabbits.”“You’re nuts,” said Crooks. “You’re crazy as a wedge. What rabbits you talkin’ about?”“The rabbits we’re gonna get, and I get to tend ’em, cut grass an’ give ’em water, an’ like that.”“Jus’ nuts,” said Crooks. “I don’t blame the guy you travel with for keepin’ you outa sight.”Lennie said quietly. “It ain’t no lie. We’re gonna do it. Gonna get a little place an’ live on the fatta the lan’.”Crooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk. “Set down,” he invited. “Set down on the nail keg.”Lennie hunched down on the little barrel. “You think it’s a lie,” Lennie said, “But it ain’t no lie. Ever’ word’s the truth, an’ you can ast George.”Crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. “You travel aroun’ with George, don’t ya?”“Sure. Me an’ him goes ever’ place together.”Crooks continued. “Sometimes he talks, and you don’t know what the hell he’s talkin’ about. Ain’t that so?” He leaned forward, boring Lennie with his deep eyes. “Ain’t that so?”“Yeah … sometimes.”“Jus’ talks on, an’ you don’t know what the hell it’s all about?”“Yeah … sometimes. But … not always.”Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk. “I ain’t a southern negro,” he said. “I was born right here in California. My old man had a chicken ranch, ’bout ten acres. The white kids come to play at our place, an’ sometimes I went to play with them, and some of them was pretty nice. My ol’ man didn’t like that. I never knew till long later why he didn’t like that. But I know now.” He hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. “There wasn’t another colored family for miles around. And now there ain’t a colored man on this ranch an’ there’s jus’ one family in Soledad.” He laughed. “If I say something, why it’s just a nigger sayin’ it.”Lennie asked, “How long you think it’ll be before them pups will be old enough to pet?”Crooks laughed again. “A guy can talk to you an’ be sure you won’t go blabbin’. Couple of weeks an’ them pups’ll be all right. George knows what he’s about. Jus’ talks, an’ you don’t understand nothing.” He leaned forward excitedly. “This is just a nigger talkin’, an’ a busted–back nigger. So it don’t mean nothing, see? You couldn’t remember it anyways. I seen it over an’ over—a guy talkin’ to another guy and it don’t make no difference if he don’t hear or understand. The thing is, they’re talkin’, or they’re settin’ still not talkin’. It don’t make no difference, no difference.” His excitement had increased until he pounded his knee with his hand. “George can tell you screwy things, and it don’t matter. It’s just the talking. It’s just bein’ with another guy. That’s all.” He paused.His voice grew soft and persuasive. “S’pose George don’t come back no more. S’pose he took a powder and just ain’t coming back. What’ll you do then?”Lennie’s attention came gradually to what had been said. “What?” he demanded.“I said s’pose George went into town tonight and you never heard of him no more.” Crooks pressed forward some kind of private victory. “Just s’pose that,” he repeated.“He won’t do it,” Lennie cried. “George wouldn’t do nothing like that. I been with George a long time. He’ll come back tonight——” But the doubt was too much for him. “Don’t you think he will?”Crooks’ face lighted with pleasure in his torture. “Nobody can’t tell what a guy’ll do,” he observed calmly. “Le’s say he wants to come back and can’t. S’pose he gets killed or hurt so he can’t come back.”Lennie struggled to understand. “George won’t do nothing like that,” he repeated. “George is careful. He won’t get hurt. He ain’t never been hurt, ’cause he’s careful.”“Well, s’pose, jus’ s’pose he don’t come back. What’ll you do then?”Lennie’s face wrinkled with apprehension. “I don’ know. Say, what you doin’ anyways?” he cried. “This ain’t true. George ain’t got hurt.”Crooks bored in on him. “Want me ta tell ya what’ll happen? They’ll take ya to the booby hatch. They’ll tie ya up with a collar, like a dog.”Suddenly Lennie’s eyes centered and grew quiet, and mad. He stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. “Who hurt George?” he demanded.Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on his bunk to get out of the way. “I was just supposin’,” he said. “George ain’t hurt. He’s all right. He’ll be back all right.”Lennie stood over him. “What you supposin’ for? Ain’t nobody goin’ to suppose no hurt to George.”Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers. “Jus’ set down,” he said. “George ain’t hurt.”Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg. “Ain’t nobody goin’ to talk no hurt to George,” he grumbled.Crooks said gently, “Maybe you can see now. You got George. You know he’s goin’ to come back. S’pose you didn’t have nobody. S’pose you couldn’t go into the bunk house and play rummy ’cause you was black. How’d you like that? S’pose you had to sit out here an’ read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain’t no good. A guy needs somebody—to be near him.” He whined, “A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who the guy is, long’s he’s with you. I tell ya,” he cried, “I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets sick.”“George gonna come back,” Lennie reassured himself in a frightened voice. “Maybe George come back already. Maybe I better go see.”Crooks said, “I didn’t mean to scare you. He’ll come back. I was talkin’ about myself. A guy sets alone out here at night, maybe readin’ books or thinkin’ or stuff like that. Sometimes he gets thinkin’, an’ he got nothing to tell him what’s so an’ what ain’t so. Maybe if he sees somethin’, he don’t know whether it’s right or not. He can’t turn to some other guy and ast him if he sees it too. He can’t tell. He got nothing to measure by. I seen things out here. I wasn’t drunk. I don’t know if I was asleep. If some guy was with me, he could tell me I was asleep, an’ then it would be all right. But I jus’ don’t know.” Crooks was looking across the room now, looking toward the window.Lennie said miserably, “George wun’t go away and leave me. I know George wun’t do that.”The stable buck went on dreamily, “I remember when I was a little kid on my old man’s chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They was always near me, always there. Used to sleep right in the same room, right in the same bed—all three. Had a strawberry patch. Had an alfalfa patch. Used to turn the chickens out in the alfalfa on a sunny morning. My brothers’d set on a fence rail an’ watch ’em—white chickens they was.”Gradually Lennie’s interest came around to what was being said. “George says we’re gonna have alfalfa for the rabbits.”“What rabbits?”“We’re gonna have rabbits an’ a berry patch.”“You’re nuts.”“We are too. You ast George.”“You’re nuts.” Crooks was scornful. “I seen hunderds of men come by on the road an’ on the ranches, with their bindles on their back an’ that same damn thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They come, an’ they quit an’ go on; an’ every damn one of ’em’s got a little piece of land in his head. An’ never a God damn one of ’em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever’body wants a little piece of lan’. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land. It’s just in their head. They’re all the time talkin’ about it, but it’s jus’ in their head.” He paused and looked toward the open door, for the horses were moving restlessly and the halter chains clinked. A horse whinnied. “I guess somebody’s out there,” Crooks said. “Maybe Slim. Slim comes in sometimes two, three times a night. Slim’s a real skinner. He looks out for his team.” He pulled himself painfully upright and moved toward the door. “That you, Slim?” he called.Candy’s voice answered. “Slim went in town. Say, you seen Lennie?”“Ya mean the big guy?”“Yeah. Seen him around any place?”“He’s in here,” Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and lay down.Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking blindly into the lighted room. He made no attempt to enter. “Tell ya what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them rabbits.”Crooks said irritably, “You can come in if you want.”Candy seemed embarrassed. “I do’ know. ’Course, if ya want me to.”“Come on in. If ever’body’s comin’ in, you might just as well.” It was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger.Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. “You got a nice cozy little place in here,” he said to Crooks. “Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way.”“Sure,” said Crooks. “And a manure pile under the window. Sure, it’s swell.”Lennie broke in, “You said about them rabbits.”Candy leaned against the wall beside the broken collar while he scratched the wrist stump. “I been here a long time,” he said. “An’ Crooks been here a long time. This’s the first time I ever been in his room.”Crooks said darkly, “Guys don’t come into a colored man’s room very much. Nobody been here but Slim. Slim an’ the boss.”Candy quickly changed the subject. “Slim’s as good a skinner as I ever seen.”Lennie leaned toward the old swamper. “About them rabbits,” he insisted.Candy smiled. “I got it figured out. We can make some money on them rabbits if we go about it right.”“But I get to tend ’em,” Lennie broke in. “George says I get to tend ’em. He promised.”Crooks interrupted brutally. “You guys is just kiddin’ yourself. You’ll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won’t get no land. You’ll be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too many guys. Lennie here’ll quit an’ be on the road in two, three weeks. Seems like ever’ guy got land in his head.”Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. “You God damn right we’re gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now.”“Yeah?” said Crooks. “An’ where’s George now? In town in a whore house. That’s where your money’s goin’. Jesus, I seen it happen too many times. I seen too many guys with land in their head. They never get none under their hand.”Candy cried, “Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of land, not much. Jus’ som’thin’ that was his. Somethin’ he could live on and there couldn’t nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. I planted crops for damn near ever’body in this state, but they wasn’t my crops, and when I harvested ’em, it wasn’t none of my harvest. But we gonna do it now, and don’t make no mistake about that. George ain’t got the money in town. That money’s in the bank. Me an’ Lennie an’ George. We gonna have a room to ourself. Were gonna have a dog an’ rabbits an’ chickens. We’re gonna have green corn an’ maybe a cow or a goat.” He stopped, overwhelmed with his picture.Crooks asked, “You say you got the money?”“Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little bit more to get. Have it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too.”Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand. “I never seen a guy really do it,” he said. “I seen guys nearly crazy with loneliness for land, but ever’ time a whore house or a blackjack game took what it takes.” He hesitated. “…If you … guys would want a hand to work for nothing—just his keep, why I’d come an’ lend a hand. I ain’t so crippled I can’t work like a son–of–a–bitch if I want to.”“Any you boys seen Curley?”They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley’s wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. She breathed strongly, as though she had been running.“Curley ain’t been here,” Candy said sourly.She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other. And her eyes traveled from one face to another. “They left all the weak ones here,” she said finally. “Think I don’t know where they all went? Even Curley, I know where they all went.”Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, “Then if you know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?”She regarded them amusedly. “Funny thing,” she said. “If I catch any one man, and he’s alone, I get along fine with him. But just let two of the guys get together an’ you won’t talk. Jus’ nothing but mad.” She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips. “You’re all scared of each other, that’s what. Ever’ one of you’s scared the rest is goin’ to get something on you.”After a pause Crooks said, “Maybe you better go along to your own house now. We don’t want no trouble.”“Well, I ain’t giving you no trouble. Think I don’t like to talk to somebody ever’ once in a while? Think I like to stick in that house alla time?”Candy laid the stump of his wrist on his knee and rubbed it gently with his hand. He said accusingly, “You gotta husban’. You got no call foolin’ aroun’ with other guys, causin’ trouble.”The girl flared up. “Sure I gotta husban’. You all seen him. Swell guy, ain’t he? Spends all his time sayin’ what he’s gonna do to guys he don’t like, and he don’t like nobody. Think I’m gonna stay in that two–by–four house and listen how Curley’s gonna lead with his left twict, and then bring in the ol’ right cross? ‘One–two’ he says. ‘Jus the ol’ one–two an’ he’ll go down.’” She paused and her face lost its sullenness and grew interested. “Say—what happened to Curley’s han’?”There was an embarrassed silence. Candy stole a look at Lennie. Then he coughed. “Why … Curley … he got his han’ caught in a machine, ma’am. Bust his han’.”She watched for a moment, and then she laughed. “Baloney! What you think you’re sellin’ me? Curley started som’pin’ he didn’ finish. Caught in a machine—baloney! Why, he ain’t give nobody the good ol’ one–two since he got his han’ bust. Who bust him?”Candy repeated sullenly, “Got it caught in a machine.”“Awright,” she said contemptuously. “Awright, cover ’im up if ya wanta. Whatta I care? You bindle bums think you’re so damn good. Whatta ya think I am, a kid? I tell ya I could of went with shows. Not jus’ one, neither. An’ a guy tol’ me he could put me in pitchers….” She was breathless with indignation. “—Sat’iday night. Ever’body out doin’ som’pin’. Ever’body! An’ what am I doin’? Standin’ here talkin’ to a bunch of bindle stiffs—a nigger an’ a dum–dum and a lousy ol’ sheep—an’ likin’ it because they ain’t nobody else.”Lennie watched her, his mouth half open. Crooks had retired into the terrible protective dignity of the negro. But a change came over old Candy. He stood up suddenly and knocked his nail keg over backward. “I had enough,” he said angrily. “You ain’t wanted here. We told you you ain’t. An’ I tell ya, you got floozy idears about what us guys amounts to. You ain’t got sense enough in that chicken head to even see that we ain’t stiffs. S’pose you get us canned. S’pose you do. You think we’ll hit the highway an’ look for another lousy two–bit job like this. You don’t know that we got our own ranch to go to, an’ our own house. We ain’t got to stay here. We gotta house and chickens an’ fruit trees an’ a place a hunderd time prettier than this. An’ we got fren’s, that’s what we got. Maybe there was a time when we was scared of gettin’ canned, but we ain’t no more. We got our own lan’, and it’s ours, an’ we c’n go to it.”Curley’s wife laughed at him. “Baloney,” she said. “I seen too many you guys. If you had two bits in the worl’, why you’d be in gettin’ two shots of corn with it and suckin’ the bottom of the glass. I know you guys.”Candy’s face had grown redder and redder, but before she was done speaking, he had control of himself. He was the master of the situation. “I might of knew,” he said gently. “Maybe you just better go along an’ roll your hoop. We ain’t got nothing to say to you at all. We know what we got, and we don’t care whether you know it or not. So maybe you better jus’ scatter along now, ’cause Curley maybe ain’t gonna like his wife out in the barn with us ‘bindle stiffs.’”She looked from one face to another, and they were all closed against her. And she looked longest at Lennie, until he dropped his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly she said, “Where’d you get them bruises on your face?”Lennie looked up guiltily. “Who—me?”“Yeah, you.”Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he looked at his lap again. “He got his han’ caught in a machine,” he said.Curley’s wife laughed. “O.K., Machine. I’ll talk to you later. I like machines.”Candy broke in. “You let this guy alone. Don’t you do no messing aroun’ with him. I’m gonna tell George what you says. George won’t have you messin’ with Lennie.”“Who’s George?” she asked. “The little guy you come with?”Lennie smiled happily. “That’s him,” he said. “That’s the guy, an’ he’s gonna let me tend the rabbits.”“Well, if that’s all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself.”Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. “I had enough,” he said coldly. “You got no rights comin’ in a colored man’s room. You got no rights messing around in here at all. Now you jus’ get out, an’ get out quick. If you don’t, I’m gonna ast the boss not to ever let you come in the barn no more.”She turned on him in scorn. “Listen, Nigger,” she said. “You know what I can do to you if you open your trap?”Crooks stared hopelessly at her, and then he sat down on his bunk and drew into himself.She closed on him. “You know what I could do?”Crooks seemed to grow smaller, and he pressed himself against the wall. “Yes, ma’am.”“Well, you keep your place then, Nigger. I could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain’t even funny.”Crooks had reduced himself to nothing. There was no personality, no ego—nothing to arouse either like or dislike. He said, “Yes, ma’am,” and his voice was toneless.For a moment she stood over him as though waiting for him to move so that she could whip at him again; but Crooks sat perfectly still, his eyes averted, everything that might be hurt drawn in. She turned at last to the other two.Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. “If you was to do that, we’d tell,” he said quietly. “We’d tell about you framin’ Crooks.”“Tell an’ be damned,” she cried. “Nobody’d listen to you, an’ you know it. Nobody’d listen to you.”Candy subsided. “No … ” he agreed. “Nobody’d listen to us.”Lennie whined, “I wisht George was here. I wisht George was here.”Candy stepped over to him. “Don’t you worry none,” he said. “I jus’ heard the guys comin’ in. George’ll be in the bunk house right now, I bet.” He turned to Curley’s wife. “You better go home now,” he said quietly. “If you go right now, we won’t tell Curley you was here.”She appraised him coolly. “I ain’t sure you heard nothing.”“Better not take no chances,” he said. “If you ain’t sure, you better take the safe way.”She turned to Lennie. “I’m glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He got it comin’ to him. Sometimes I’d like to bust him myself.” She slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And while she went through the barn, the halter chains rattled, and some horses snorted and some stamped their feet.Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the layers of protection he had put on. “Was that the truth what you said about the guys come back?” he asked.“Sure. I heard ’em.”“Well, I didn’t hear nothing.”“The gate banged,” Candy said, and he went on, “Jesus Christ, Curley’s wife can move quiet. I guess she had a lot of practice, though.”Crooks avoided the whole subject now. “Maybe you guys better go,” he said. “I ain’t sure I want you in here no more. A colored man got to have some rights even if he don’t like ’em.”Candy said, “That bitch didn’t ought to of said that to you.”“It wasn’t nothing,” Crooks said dully. “You guys comin’ in an’ settin’ made me forget. What she says is true.”The horses snorted out in the barn and the chains rang and a voice called, “Lennie. Oh, Lennie. You in the barn?”“It’s George,” Lennie cried. And he answered, “Here, George. I’m right in here.”In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked disapprovingly about. “What you doin’ in Crooks’ room. You hadn’t ought to be in here.”Crooks nodded. “I tol’ ’em, but they come in anyways.”“Well, why’n’t you kick ’em out?”“I di’n’t care much,” said Crooks. “Lennie’s a nice fella.”Now Candy aroused himself. “Oh, George! I been figurin’ and figurin’. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on them rabbits.”George scowled. “I thought I tol’ you not to tell nobody about that.”Candy was crestfallen. “Didn’t tell nobody but Crooks.”George said, “Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I can’t go away for a minute.”Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks called, “Candy!”“Huh?”“’Member what I said about hoein’ and doin’ odd jobs?”“Yeah,” said Candy. “I remember.”“Well, jus’ forget it,” said Crooks. “I didn’ mean it. Jus’ foolin’. I wouldn’ want to go no place like that.”“Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Goodnight.”The three men went out of the door. As they went through the barn the horses snorted and the halter chains rattled.Crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the door for a moment, and then he reached for the liniment bottle. He pulled out his shirt in back, poured a little liniment in his pink palm and, reaching around, he fell slowly to rubbing his back.'),
(43, 6, 'ch05', 7, ' 55One end of the great barn was piled high with new hay and over the pile hung the four–taloned Jackson fork suspended from its pulley. The hay came down like a mountain slope to the other end of the barn, and there was a level place as yet unfilled with the new crop. At the sides the feeding racks were visible, and between the slats the heads of horses could be seen.It was Sunday afternoon. The resting horses nibbled the remaining wisps of hay, and they stamped their feet and they bit the wood of the mangers and rattled the halter chains. The afternoon sun sliced in through the cracks of the barn walls and lay in bright lines on the hay. There was the buzz of flies in the air, the lazy afternoon humming.From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the playing peg and the shouts of men, playing, encouraging, jeering. But in the barn it was quiet and humming and lazy and warm.Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat in the hay beside a packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not been filled with hay. Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little dead puppy that lay in front of him. Lennie looked at it for a long time, and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it, stroked it clear from one end to the other.And Lennie said softly to the puppy, “Why do you got to get killed? You ain’t so little as mice. I didn’t bounce you hard.” He bent the pup’s head up and looked in its face, and he said to it, “Now maybe George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits, if he fin’s out you got killed.”He scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it and covered it over with hay, out of sight; but he continued to stare at the mound he had made. He said, “This ain’t no bad thing like I got to go hide in the brush. Oh! no. This ain’t. I’ll tell George I foun’ it dead.”He unburied the puppy and inspected it, and he stroked it from ears to tail. He went on sorrowfully, “But he’ll know. George always knows. He’ll say, ‘You done it. Don’t try to put nothing over on me.’ An’ he’ll say, ‘Now jus’ for that you don’t get to tend no rabbits!’”Suddenly his anger arose. “God damn you,” he cried. “Why do you got to get killed? You ain’t so little as mice.” He picked up the pup and hurled it from him. He turned his back on it. He sat bent over his knees and he whispered, “Now I won’t get to tend the rabbits. Now he won’t let me.” He rocked himself back and forth in his sorrow.From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the iron stake, and then a little chorus of cries. Lennie got up and brought the puppy back and laid it on the hay and sat down. He stroked the pup again. “You wasn’t big enough,” he said. “They tol’ me and tol’ me you wasn’t. I di’n’t know you’d get killed so easy.” He worked his fingers on the pup’s limp ear. “Maybe George won’t care,” he said. “This here God damn little son–of–a–bitch wasn’t nothing to George.”Curley’s wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very quietly, so that Lennie didn’t see her. She wore her bright cotton dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her.In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He looked sullenly up at her.She said, “What you got there, sonny boy?”Lennie glared at her. “George says I ain’t to have nothing to do with you—talk to you or nothing.”She laughed. “George giving you orders about everything?”Lennie looked down at the hay. “Says I can’t tend no rabbits if I talk to you or anything.”She said quietly, “He’s scared Curley’ll get mad. Well, Curley got his arm in a sling—an’ if Curley gets tough, you can break his other han’. You didn’t put nothing over on me about gettin’ it caught in no machine.”But Lennie was not to be drawn. “No, sir. I ain’t gonna talk to you or nothing.”She knelt in the hay beside him. “Listen,” she said. “All the guys got a horseshoe tenement goin’ on. It’s on’y about four o’clock. None of them guys is goin’ to leave that tenement. Why can’t I talk to you? I never get to talk to nobody. I get awful lonely.”Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to talk to you or nothing.”“I get lonely,” she said. “You can talk to people, but I can’t talk to nobody but Curley. Else he gets mad. How’d you like not to talk to anybody?”Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to. George’s scared I’ll get in trouble.”She changed the subject. “What you got covered up there?”Then all of Lennie’s woe came back on him. “Jus’ my pup,” he said sadly. “Jus’ my little pup.” And he swept the hay from on top of it.“Why, he’s dead,” she cried.“He was so little,” said Lennie. “I was jus’ playin’ with him … an’ he made like he’s gonna bite me … an’ I made like I was gonna smack him … an’ … an’ I done it. An’ then he was dead.”She consoled him. “Don’t you worry none. He was jus’ a mutt. You can get another one easy. The whole country is fulla mutts.”“It ain’t that so much,” Lennie explained miserably. “George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits now.”“Why don’t he?”“Well, he said if I done any more bad things he ain’t gonna let me tend the rabbits.”She moved closer to him and she spoke soothingly. “Don’t you worry about talkin’ to me. Listen to the guys yell out there. They got four dollars bet in that tenement. None of them ain’t gonna leave till it’s over.”“If George sees me talkin’ to you he’ll give me hell,” Lennie said cautiously. “He tol’ me so.”Her face grew angry. “Wha’s the matter with me?” she cried. “Ain’t I got a right to talk to nobody? Whatta they think I am, anyways? You’re a nice guy. I don’t know why I can’t talk to you. I ain’t doin’ no harm to you.”“Well, George says you’ll get us in a mess.”“Aw, nuts!” she said. “What kinda harm am I doin’ to you? Seems like they ain’t none of them cares how I gotta live. I tell you I ain’t used to livin’ like this. I coulda made somethin’ of myself.” She said darkly, “Maybe I will yet.” And then her words tumbled out in a passion of communication, as though she hurried before her listener could be taken away. “I lived right in Salinas,” she said. “Come there when I was a kid. Well, a show come through, an’ I met one of the actors. He says I could go with that show. But my ol’ lady wouldn’ let me. She says because I was on’y fifteen. But the guy says I coulda. If I’d went, I wouldn’t be livin’ like this, you bet.”Lennie stroked the pup back and forth. “We gonna have a little place—an’ rabbits,” he explained.She went on with her story quickly, before she should be interrupted. “’Nother time I met a guy, an’ he was in pitchers. Went out to the Riverside Dance Palace with him. He says he was gonna put me in the movies. Says I was a natural. Soon’s he got back to Hollywood he was gonna write to me about it.” She looked closely at Lennie to see whether she was impressing him. “I never got that letter,” she said. “I always thought my ol’ lady stole it. Well, I wasn’t gonna stay no place where I couldn’t get nowhere or make something of myself, an’ where they stole your letters. I ast her if she stole it, too, an’ she says no. So I married Curley. Met him out to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night.” She demanded, “You listenin’?”“Me? Sure.”“Well, I ain’t told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought’n to. I don’ like Curley. He ain’t a nice fella.” And because she had confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him. “Coulda been in the movies, an’ had nice clothes—all them nice clothes like they wear. An’ I coulda sat in them big hotels, an’ had pitchers took of me. When they had them previews I coulda went to them, an’ spoke in the radio, an’ it wouldn’ta cost me a cent because I was in the pitcher. An’ all them nice clothes like they wear. Because this guy says I was a natural.” She looked up at Lennie, and she made a small grand gesture with her arm and hand to show that she could act. The fingers trailed after her leading wrist, and her little finger stuck out grandly from the rest.Lennie sighed deeply. From outside came the clang of a horseshoe on metal, and then a chorus of cheers. “Somebody made a ringer,” said Curley’s wife.Now the light was lifting as the sun went down, and the sun streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and over the heads of the horses.Lennie said, “Maybe if I took this pup out and throwed him away George wouldn’t never know. An’ then I could tend the rabbits without no trouble.”Curley’s wife said angrily, “Don’t you think of nothing but rabbits?”“We gonna have a little place,” Lennie explained patiently. “We gonna have a house an’ a garden and a place for alfalfa, an’ that alfalfa is for the rabbits, an’ I take a sack and get it all fulla alfalfa and then I take it to the rabbits.”She asked, “What makes you so nuts about rabbits?”Lennie had to think carefully before he could come to a conclusion. He moved cautiously close to her, until he was right against her. “I like to pet nice things. Once at a fair I seen some of them long–hair rabbits. An’ they was nice, you bet. Sometimes I’ve even pet mice, but not when I could get nothing better.”Curley’s wife moved away from him a little. “I think you’re nuts,” she said.“No I ain’t,” Lennie explained earnestly. “George says I ain’t. I like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof’ things.”She was a little bit reassured. “Well, who don’t?” she said. “Ever’body likes that. I like to feel silk an’ velvet. Do you like to feel velvet?”Lennie chuckled with pleasure. “You bet, by God,” he cried happily. “An’ I had some, too. A lady give me some, an’ that lady was—my own Aunt Clara. She give it right to me—’bout this big a piece. I wisht I had that velvet right now.” A frown came over his face. “I lost it,” he said. “I ain’t seen it for a long time.”Curley’s wife laughed at him. “You’re nuts,” she said. “But you’re a kinda nice fella. Jus’ like a big baby. But a person can see kinda what you mean. When I’m doin’ my hair sometimes I jus’ set an’ stroke it ’cause it’s so soft.” To show how she did it, she ran her fingers over the top of her head. “Some people got kinda coarse hair,” she said complacently. “Take Curley. His hair is jus’ like wire. But mine is soft and fine. ’Course I brush it a lot. That makes it fine. Here—feel right here.” She took Lennie’s hand and put it on her head. “Feel right aroun’ there an’ see how soft it is.”Lennie’s big fingers fell to stroking her hair.“Don’t you muss it up,” she said.Lennie said, “Oh! That’s nice,” and he stroked harder. “Oh, that’s nice.”“Look out, now, you’ll muss it.” And then she cried angrily, “You stop it now, you’ll mess it all up.” She jerked her head sideways, and Lennie’s fingers closed on her hair and hung on. “Let go,” she cried. “You let go!”Lennie was in a panic. His face was contorted. She screamed then, and Lennie’s other hand closed over her mouth and nose. “Please don’t,” he begged. “Oh! Please don’t do that. George’ll be mad.”She struggled violently under his hands. Her feet battered on the hay and she writhed to be free; and from under Lennie’s hand came a muffled screaming. Lennie began to cry with fright. “Oh! Please don’t do none of that,” he begged. “George gonna say I done a bad thing. He ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits.” He moved his hand a little and her hoarse cry came out. Then Lennie grew angry. “Now don’t,” he said. “I don’t want you to yell. You gonna get me in trouble jus’ like George says you will. Now don’t you do that.” And she continued to struggle, and her eyes were wild with terror. He shook her then, and he was angry with her. “Don’t you go yellin’,” he said, and he shook her; and her body flopped like a fish. And then she was still, for Lennie had broken her neck.He looked down at her, and carefully he removed his hand from over her mouth, and she lay still. “I don’t want ta hurt you,” he said, “but George’ll be mad if you yell.” When she didn’t answer nor move he bent closely over her. He lifted her arm and let it drop. For a moment he seemed bewildered. And then he whispered in fright, “I done a bad thing. I done another bad thing.”He pawed up the hay until it partly covered her.From outside the barn came a cry of men and the double clang of shoes on metal. For the first time Lennie became conscious of the outside. He crouched down in the hay and listened. “I done a real bad thing,” he said. “I shouldn’t of did that. George’ll be mad. An’ … he said …an’ hide in the brush till he come. He’s gonna be mad. In the brush till he come. Tha’s what he said.” Lennie went back and looked at the dead girl. The puppy lay close to her. Lennie picked it up. “I’ll throw him away,” he said. “It’s bad enough like it is.” He put the pup under his coat, and he crept to the barn wall and peered out between the cracks, toward the horseshoe game. And then he crept around the end of the last manger and disappeared.The sun streaks were high on the wall by now, and the light was growing soft in the barn. Curley’s wife lay on her back, and she was half covered with hay.It was very quiet in the barn, and the quiet of the afternoon was on the ranch. Even the clang of the pitched shoes, even the voices of the men in the game seemed to grow more quiet. The air in the barn was dusky in advance of the outside day. A pigeon flew in through the open hay door and circled and flew out again. Around the last stall came a shepherd bitch, lean and long, with heavy, hanging dugs. Halfway to the packing box where the puppies were she caught the dead scent of Curley’s wife, and the hair rose along her spine. She whimpered and cringed to the packing box, and jumped in among the puppies.Curley’s wife lay with a half–covering of yellow hay. And the meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face. She was very pretty and simple, and her face was sweet and young. Now her rouged cheeks and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very lightly. The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on the hay behind her head, and her lips were parted.As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment. And sound stopped and movement stopped for much, much more than a moment.Then gradually time awakened again and moved sluggishly on. The horses stamped on the other side of the feeding racks and the halter chains clinked. Outside, the men’s voices became louder and clearer.From around the end of the last stall old Candy’s voice came. “Lennie,” he called. “Oh, Lennie! You in here? I been figuring some more. Tell you what we can do, Lennie.” Old Candy appeared around the end of the last stall. “Oh, Lennie!” he called again; and then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth wrist on his white stubble whiskers. “I di’n’t know you was here,” he said to Curley’s wife.When she didn’t answer, he stepped nearer. “You oughten to sleep out here,” he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and—“Oh, Jesus Christ!” He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.But the barn was alive now. The horses stamped and snorted, and they chewed the straw of their bedding and they clashed the chains of their halters. In a moment Candy came back, and George was with him.George said, “What was it you wanted to see me about?”Candy pointed at Curley’s wife. George stared. “What’s the matter with her?” he asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed Candy’s words. “Oh, Jesus Christ!” He was down on his knees beside her. He put his hand over her heart. And finally, when he stood up, slowly and stiffly, his face was as hard and tight as wood, and his eyes were hard.Candy said, “What done it?”George looked coldly at him. “Ain’t you got any idear?” he asked. And Candy was silent. “I should of knew,” George said hopelessly. “I guess maybe way back in my head I did.”Candy asked, “What we gonna do now, George? What we gonna do now?”George was a long time in answering. “Guess … we gotta tell the …guys. I guess we gotta get ’im an’ lock ’im up. We can’t let ’im get away. Why, the poor bastard’d starve.” And he tried to reassure himself. “Maybe they’ll lock ’im up an’ be nice to ’im.”But Candy said excitedly, “We oughtta let ’im get away. You don’t know that Curley. Curley gon’ta wanta get ’im lynched. Curley’ll get ’im killed.”George watched Candy’s lips. “Yeah,” he said at last, “that’s right, Curley will. An’ the other guys will.” And he looked back at Curley’s wife.Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. “You an’ me can get that little place, can’t we, George? You an’ me can go there an’ live nice, can’t we, George? Can’t we?”Before George answered, Candy dropped his head and looked down at the hay. He knew.George said softly, “—I think I knowed from the very first. I think I knowed we’d never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I got to thinking maybe we would.”“Then—it’s all off?” Candy asked sulkily.George didn’t answer his question. George said, “I’ll work my month an’ I’ll take my fifty bucks an’ I’ll stay all night in some lousy cat house. Or I’ll set in some poolroom till ever’body goes home. An’ then I’ll come back an’ work another month an’ I’ll have fifty bucks more.”Candy said, “He’s such a nice fella. I didn’ think he’d do nothing like this.”George still stared at Curley’s wife. “Lennie never done it in meanness,” he said. “All the time he done bad things, but he never done one of ’em mean.” He straightened up and looked back at Candy. “Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him in, I guess. They ain’t no way out. Maybe they won’t hurt ’im.” He said sharply, “I ain’t gonna let ’em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. The guys might think I was in on it. I’m gonna go in the bunk house. Then in a minute you come out and tell the guys about her, and I’ll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do that? So the guys won’t think I was in on it?”Candy said, “Sure, George. Sure I’ll do that.”“O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin’ out an’ tell like you jus’ found her. I’m going now.” George turned and went quickly out of the barn.Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley’s wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words. “You God damn tramp,” he said viciously. “You done it, di’n’t you? I s’pose you’re glad. Ever’body knowed you’d mess things up. You wasn’t no good. You ain’t no good now, you lousy tart.” He sniveled, and his voice shook. “I could of hoed in the garden and washed dishes for them guys.” He paused, and then went on in a singsong. And he repeated the old words: “If they was a circus or a baseball game … we would of went to her … jus’ said ‘ta hell with work,’ an’ went to her. Never ast nobody’s say so. An’ they’d of been a pig and chickens … an’ in the winter … the little fat stove … an’ the rain comin’ … an’ us jus’ settin’ there.” His eyes blinded with tears and he turned and went weakly out of the barn, and he rubbed his bristly whiskers with his wrist stump.Outside the noise of the game stopped. There was a rise of voices in question, a drum of running feet and the men burst into the barn. Slim and Carlson and young Whit and Curley, and Crooks keeping back out of attention range. Candy came after them, and last of all came George. George had put on his blue denim coat and buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes. The men raced around the last stall. Their eyes found Curley’s wife in the gloom, they stopped and stood still and looked.Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he felt her wrist. One lean finger touched her cheek, and then his hand went under her slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck. When he stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken.Curley came suddenly to life. “I know who done it,” he cried. “That big son–of–a–bitch done it. I know he done it. Why—ever’body else was out there playin’ horseshoes.” He worked himself into a fury. “I’m gonna get him. I’m going for my shotgun. I’ll kill the big son–of–a–bitch myself. I’ll shoot ’im in the guts. Come on, you guys.” He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, “I’ll get my Luger,” and he ran out too.Slim turned quietly to George. “I guess Lennie done it, all right,” he said. “Her neck’s bust. Lennie coulda did that.”George didn’t answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far down on his forehead that his eyes were covered.Slim went on, “Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin’ about.”Again George nodded.Slim sighed. “Well, I guess we got to get him. Where you think he might of went?”It seemed to take George some time to free his words. “He—would of went south,” he said. “We come from north so he would of went south.”“I guess we gotta get ’im,” Slim repeated.George stepped close. “Couldn’ we maybe bring him in an’ they’ll lock him up? He’s nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean.”Slim nodded. “We might,” he said. “If we could keep Curley in, we might. But Curley’s gonna want to shoot ’im. Curley’s still mad about his hand. An’ s’pose they lock him up an’ strap him down and put him in a cage. That ain’t no good, George.”“I know,” said George. “I know.”Carlson came running in. “The bastard’s stole my Luger,” he shouted. “It ain’t in my bag.” Curley followed him, and Curley carried a shotgun in his good hand. Curley was cold now.“All right, you guys,” he said. “The nigger’s got a shotgun. You take it, Carlson. When you see ’um, don’t give ’im no chance. Shoot for his guts. That’ll double ’im over.”Whit said excitedly, “I ain’t got a gun.”Curley said, “You go in Soledad an’ get a cop. Get Al Wilts, he’s deputy sheriff. Le’s go now.” He turned suspiciously on George. “You’re comin’ with us, fella.”“Yeah,” said George. “I’ll come. But listen, Curley. The poor bastard’s nuts. Don’t shoot ’im. He di’n’t know what he was doin’.”“Don’t shoot ’im?” Curley cried. “He got Carlson’s Luger. ’Course we’ll shoot ’im.”George said weakly, “Maybe Carlson lost his gun.”“I seen it this morning,” said Carlson. “No, it’s been took.”Slim stood looking down at Curley’s wife. He said, “Curley—maybe you better stay here with your wife.”Curley’s face reddened. “I’m goin’,” he said. “I’m gonna shoot the guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I’m gonna get ’im.”Slim turned to Candy. “You stay here with her then, Candy. The rest of us better get goin’.”They moved away. George stopped a moment beside Candy and they both looked down at the dead girl until Curley called, “You George! You stick with us so we don’t think you had nothin’ to do with this.”George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily.And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and watched the face of Curley’s wife. “Poor bastard,” he said softly.The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and covered his eyes with his arm.');

(44, 6, 'ch06', 8, ' 66The deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant shade had fallen.A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twisting its periscope head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and came to the legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shallows. A silent head and beak lanced down and plucked it out by the head, and the beak swallowed the little snake while its tail waved frantically.A far rush of wind sounded and a gust drove through the tops of the trees like a wave. The sycamore leaves turned up their silver sides, the brown, dry leaves on the ground scudded a few feet. And row on row of tiny wind waves flowed up the pool’s green surface.As quickly as it had come, the wind died, and the clearing was quiet again. The heron stood in the shallows, motionless and waiting. Another little water snake swam up the pool, turning its periscope head from side to side.Suddenly Lennie appeared out of the brush, and he came as silently as a creeping bear moves. The heron pounded the air with its wings, jacked itself clear of the water and flew off down river. The little snake slid in among the reeds at the pool’s side.Lennie came quietly to the pool’s edge. He knelt down and drank, barely touching his lips to the water. When a little bird skittered over the dry leaves behind him, his head jerked up and he strained toward the sound with eyes and ears until he saw the bird, and then he dropped his head and drank again.When he was finished, he sat down on the bank, with his side to the pool, so that he could watch the trail’s entrance. He embraced his knees and laid his chin down on his knees.The light climbed on out of the valley, and as it went, the tops of the mountains seemed to blaze with increasing brightness.Lennie said softly, “I di’n’t forget, you bet, God damn. Hide in the brush an’ wait for George.” He pulled his hat down low over his eyes. “George gonna give me hell,” he said. “George gonna wish he was alone an’ not have me botherin’ him.” He turned his head and looked at the bright mountain tops. “I can go right off there an’ find a cave,” he said. And he continued sadly, “—an’ never have no ketchup—but I won’t care. If George don’t want me … I’ll go away. I’ll go away.”And then from out of Lennie’s head there came a little fat old woman. She wore thick bull’s–eye glasses and she wore a huge gingham apron with pockets, and she was starched and clean. She stood in front of Lennie and put her hands on her hips, and she frowned disapprovingly at him.And when she spoke, it was in Lennie’s voice. “I tol’ you an’ tol’ you,” she said. “I tol’ you, ‘Min’ George because he’s such a nice fella an’ good to you.’ But you don’t never take no care. You do bad things.”And Lennie answered her, “I tried, Aunt Clara, ma’am. I tried and tried. I couldn’ help it.”“You never give a thought to George,” she went on in Lennie’s voice. “He been doin’ nice things for you alla time. When he got a piece a pie you always got half or more’n half. An’ if they was any ketchup, why he’d give it all to you.”“I know,” said Lennie miserably. “I tried, Aunt Clara, ma’am. I tried and tried.”She interrupted him. “All the time he coulda had such a good time if it wasn’t for you. He woulda took his pay an’ raised hell in a whore house, and he coulda set in a pool room an’ played snooker. But he got to take care of you.”Lennie moaned with grief. “I know, Aunt Clara, ma’am. I’ll go right off in the hills an’ I’ll fin’ a cave an’ I’ll live there so I won’t be no more trouble to George.”“You jus’ say that,” she said sharply. “You’re always sayin’ that, an’ you know sonofabitching well you ain’t never gonna do it. You’ll jus’ stick around an’ stew the b’Jesus outa George all the time.”Lennie said, “I might jus’ as well go away. George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits now.”Aunt Clara was gone, and from out of Lennie’s head there came a gigantic rabbit. It sat on its haunches in front of him, and it waggled its ears and crinkled its nose at him. And it spoke in Lennie’s voice too.“Tend rabbits,” it said scornfully. “You crazy bastard. You ain’t fit to lick the boots of no rabbit. You’d forget ’em and let ’em go hungry. That’s what you’d do. An’ then what would George think?”“I would not forget,” Lennie said loudly.“The hell you wouldn’,” said the rabbit. “You ain’t worth a greased jack–pin to ram you into hell. Christ knows George done ever’thing he could to jack you outa the sewer, but it don’t do no good. If you think George gonna let you tend rabbits, you’re even crazier’n usual. He ain’t. He’s gonna beat hell outa you with a stick, that’s what he’s gonna do.”Now Lennie retorted belligerently, “He ain’t neither. George won’t do nothing like that. I’ve knew George since—I forget when—and he ain’t never raised his han’ to me with a stick. He’s nice to me. He ain’t gonna be mean.”“Well he’s sick of you,” said the rabbit. “He’s gonna beat hell outa you an’ then go away an’ leave you.”“He won’t,” Lennie cried frantically. “He won’t do nothing like that. I know George. Me an’ him travels together.”But the rabbit repeated softly over and over, “He gonna leave you, ya crazy bastard. He gonna leave ya all alone. He gonna leave ya, crazy bastard.”Lennie put his hands over his ears. “He ain’t, I tell ya he ain’t.” And he cried, “Oh! George—George—George!”George came quietly out of the brush and the rabbit scuttled back into Lennie’s brain.George said quietly, “What the hell you yellin’ about?”Lennie got up on his knees. “You ain’t gonna leave me, are ya, George? I know you ain’t.”George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. “No.”“I knowed it,” Lennie cried. “You ain’t that kind.”George was silent.Lennie said, “George.”“Yeah?”“I done another bad thing.”“It don’t make no difference,” George said, and he fell silent again.Only the topmost ridges were in the sun now. The shadow in the valley was blue and soft. From the distance came the sound of men shouting to one another. George turned his head and listened to the shouts.Lennie said, “George.”“Yeah?”“Ain’t you gonna give me hell?”“Give ya hell?”“Sure, like you always done before. Like, ‘If I di’n’t have you I’d take my fifty bucks—’”“Jesus Christ, Lennie! You can’t remember nothing that happens, but you remember ever’ word I say.”“Well, ain’t you gonna say it?”George shook himself. He said woodenly, “If I was alone I could live so easy.” His voice was monotonous, had no emphasis. “I could get a job an’ not have no mess.” He stopped.“Go on,” said Lennie. “An’ when the enda the month come—”“An’ when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks an’ go to a … cat house … ” He stopped again.Lennie looked eagerly at him. “Go on, George. Ain’t you gonna give me no more hell?”“No,” said George.“Well, I can go away,” said Lennie. “I’ll go right off in the hills an’ find a cave if you don’ want me.”George shook himself again. “No,” he said. “I want you to stay with me here.”Lennie said craftily—“Tell me like you done before.”“Tell you what?”“’Bout the other guys an’ about us.”George said, “Guys like us got no fambly. They make a little stake an’ then they blow it in. They ain’t got nobody in the worl’ that gives a hoot in hell about ’em—”“But not us,” Lennie cried happily. “Tell about us now.”George was quiet for a moment. “But not us,” he said.“Because—”“Because I got you an’—”“An’ I got you. We got each other, that’s what, that gives a hoot in hell about us,” Lennie cried in triumph.The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before.George took off his hat. He said shakily, “Take off your hat, Lennie. The air feels fine.”Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in front of him. The shadow in the valley was bluer, and the evening came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to them.Lennie said, “Tell how it’s gonna be.”George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he was business–like. “Look acrost the river, Lennie, an’ I’ll tell you so you can almost see it.”Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the darkening slopes of the Gabilans. “We gonna get a little place,” George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out Carlson’s Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun lay on the ground behind Lennie’s back. He looked at the back of Lennie’s head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.A man’s voice called from up the river, and another man answered.“Go on,” said Lennie.George raised the gun and his hand shook, and he dropped his hand to the ground again.“Go on,” said Lennie. “How’s it gonna be. We gonna get a little place.”“We’ll have a cow,” said George. “An’ we’ll have maybe a pig an’ chickens … an’ down the flat we’ll have a … little piece alfalfa——”“For the rabbits,” Lennie shouted.“For the rabbits,” George repeated.“And I get to tend the rabbits.”“An’ you get to tend the rabbits.”Lennie giggled with happiness. “An’ live on the fatta the lan’.”“Yes.”Lennie turned his head.“No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can almost see the place.”Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun.There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned and looked toward them.“Go on, George. When we gonna do it?”“Gonna do it soon.”“Me an’ you.”“You … an’ me. Ever’body gonna be nice to you. Ain’t gonna be no more trouble. Nobody gonna hurt nobody nor steal from ’em.”Lennie said, “I thought you was mad at me, George.”“No,” said George. “No, Lennie. I ain’t mad. I never been mad, an’ I ain’t now. That’s a thing I want ya to know.”The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to the voices.Lennie begged, “Le’s do it now. Le’s get that place now.”“Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta.”And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie’s head. The hand shook violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, and he lay without quivering.George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes.The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running feet. Slim’s voice shouted, “George. Where you at, George?”But George sat stiffly on the bank and looked at his right hand that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. “Got him, by God.” He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then he looked back at George. “Right in the back of the head,” he said softly.Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very close to him. “Never you mind,” said Slim. “A guy got to sometimes.”But Carlson was standing over George. “How’d you do it?” he asked.“I just done it,” George said tiredly.“Did he have my gun?”“Yeah. He had your gun.”“An’ you got it away from him and you took it an’ you killed him?”“Yeah. Tha’s how.” George’s voice was almost a whisper. He looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun.Slim twitched George’s elbow. “Come on, George. Me an’ you’ll go in an’ get a drink.”George let himself be helped to his feet. “Yeah, a drink.”Slim said, “You hadda, George. I swear you hadda. Come on with me.” He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward the highway.Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, “Now what the hell ya suppose is eatin’ them two guys?”');
